<h2><!-- page vii--><a name="pagevii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vii</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>In the spring of 1876 and of 1877, letters under the heading &ldquo;Uppingham
by the Sea&rdquo; were published in <i>The Times</i> newspaper, and
were read with interest by friends of the school.&nbsp; We have thought
the following narrative would be best introduced to those readers under
a name already pleasantly familiar to them, and have borrowed, with
the writer&rsquo;s permission, the title of his sketches for our own
more detailed account of the same events.</p>
<p>The readers whom we have in view will demand no apology for the attempt
to supply a circumstantial record of so memorable an <!-- page viii--><a name="pageviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. viii</span>episode
in the school&rsquo;s history.&nbsp; It deserves indeed an abler historian;
but one qualification at any rate may be claimed by the present writer:
an eye-witness from first to last, but a minor actor only in the scenes
he chronicles, he enjoyed good opportunities of watching the play, and
risks no personal modesty in relating what he saw.</p>
<p>The best purpose of the narrative will have been served if any Uppingham
boy, as he reads these pages, finds in them a new reason for loyalty
to the society whose name he bears.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Finding of Taliesin</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Elphin, son of Gwyddno, the prince who ruled the coasts between the
Dovey and the Ystwith, came down on a May-day morning to his father&rsquo;s
fishing-weir.&nbsp; All that was taken that morning <!-- page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>was
to be Elphin&rsquo;s, had Gwyddno said.&nbsp; Not a fish was taken that
day; and Elphin, who was ever a luckless youth, would have gone home
empty-handed, but that one of his men found, entangled in the poles
of the weir, a coracle, and a fair child in it.&nbsp; This was none
other than he who was to be the father of Cymry minstrelsy, and whom
then and there his rescuers named Taliesin, which means Radiant Brow.&nbsp;
His mother, Ceridwen, seeking to be rid of her infant, but loath to
have the child&rsquo;s blood on her head, had launched him in this sea
proof cradle, to take the chance of wind and wave.&nbsp; The spot where
he came to land bears at this day the name of Taliesin.&nbsp; On the
hill-top above it men show the grave where the bard reposes and &ldquo;glories
in his namesake shore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>There is something magnetic in a famous site: it attracts again a
like history to the old stage.&nbsp; Thirteen centuries and a half after
the finding of Taliesin, the same shore became once again an asylum
for other outcasts, whose fortunes we propose to chronicle.</p>
<p>But since the day when they drifted to land the cradle of the bard,
the waves have ebbed away from Gwyddno&rsquo;s weir, and left a broad
stretch of <!-- page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>marsh
and meadow between it and the present coast, where stands the fishing
village of Borth.&nbsp; The village fringes the sea-line with half a
mile of straggling cottages; but the eye is caught at once by a massive
building of white stone, standing at the head of the long street, and
forming a landmark in the plain.&nbsp; This building is the Cambrian
Hotel, reared on a scale that would suggest the neighbourhood of a populous
health-resort.&nbsp; But the melancholy silence which haunts its doors
is rarely broken, between season and season, by the presence of guests,
unless it be some chance sportsman in quest of marsh-fowl, or a land-agent
in quest of rents.</p>
<p>When, therefore, on the 15th of March, 1876, a party of four visitors&mdash;the
Rev. Edward Thring, Headmaster of Uppingham School, one of the Trustees
of the school, and two of the masters&mdash;were seen mounting the steps
of the porch, it was a sight to make the villagers wonder by what chance
so many guests came to knock at the door in that dead season.&nbsp;
Had the wind blown them hither?&nbsp; It blew a hurricane that day on
the bleak coasts of Cardigan Bay; but it was a shrewder storm yet which
had swept this windfall to the doors of Borth.</p>
<p><!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>The
story must be briefly told.&nbsp; On November 2nd, 1875, Uppingham School
was dispersed on account of a fever which had attacked both town and
school, not without fatal casualties.&nbsp; On January 28th, 1876, the
school met again.&nbsp; In the interval the school-houses had been put
in complete sanitary order, and though the efforts made to amend the
general drainage of the town had been only on a small and tentative
scale, it was thought that the school, if secure on its own premises,
might safely be recalled, in spite of remaining deficiencies outside
those limits.&nbsp; But, <i>tua res agitur</i>&mdash;the term began
with three weeks of watchful quiet, and then the blow fell again.&nbsp;
A boy sickened of the same fever; then, after an interval of suspense,
two or three fresh cases made it clear that this was no accident.&nbsp;
An inspection of the town drainage, ordered by the authorities, revealed
certain permanent sources of danger.&nbsp; It was clear that the interests
of school and town, in matters of hygiene as in others, were not separable;
perhaps the best fruit of the sequel has been the mutual conviction
that those interests are one.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the new illustration of this connection of interests had
a formidable significance for the Uppingham masters.&nbsp; Men looked
at one <!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>another
as those do who do not like to give a name to their fears.&nbsp; For
what could be done?&nbsp; The school could not be dismissed again.&nbsp;
How many would return to a site twice declared untenable?&nbsp; But
neither could it be kept on the spot: for there came in unmistakable
evidence that, in that case, the school would dissolve itself, and that,
perhaps, irrevocably, through the withdrawal of its scholars by their
parents from the dreaded neighbourhood.&nbsp; Already the trickling
had begun; something must be done before the banks broke, and the results
and hopes of more than twenty long working years were poured out to
waste.</p>
<p>When the crisis was perceived, a project which had been already the
unspoken thought in responsible quarters, but which would have sounded
like a counsel of despair had the situation been less acute, was suddenly
started in common talk and warmly entertained.&nbsp; Why should we not
anticipate calamity by flight?&nbsp; Before the school melted away,
and left us teaching empty benches, why should we not flit, master and
scholar together, and preserve the school abroad for a securer future
afterwards at home?</p>
<p>In a space of time to be measured rather by hours than days, this
project passed through the <!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>stages
of conception, discussion, and resolve, to the first step in its execution.&nbsp;
On Tuesday, March 7th, a notice was issued to parents and guardians
that the school would break up that day week for a premature Easter
holiday, and at the end of the usual three weeks reassemble in some
other locality, of which nothing could as yet be specified except that
it was to be healthier than that we were leaving.</p>
<p>The proposed experiment&mdash;to transport a large public school
from its native seat and all its appliances and plant to a strange site
of which not even the name was yet known, except as one of several possible
spots, and to do this at a few days&rsquo; notice&mdash;was no doubt
a novel one.&nbsp; But the resolve, if rapidly formed and daring, was
none the less deliberate and sane.&nbsp; Its authors must not be charged
either with panic or a passion for adventure.&nbsp; All the data of
a judgment were in view, and delay could add no new fact, except one
which would make any decision nugatory because too late.&nbsp; It was
wisdom in those with whom lay the cast of the die, to take their determination
while a school remained for which they could determine anything.</p>
<p>It was a sharp remedy, however.&nbsp; For on the <!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>morrow
of this resolve the owners of so many good houses, fields, and gardens,
all the outward and visible of Uppingham School, became, for a term
without assignable limit, landless and homeless men, and the Headmaster
almost as much disburdened of his titular realm as if he were a bishop
<i>in partibus</i> or the chief of a nomad caravan.&nbsp; It was a sharp
remedy; but those who submitted to it breathed the freer at having broken
prison, and felt something, not indeed of the recklessness which inspires
adventure, but of the elation which sustains it:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why now, blow wind, swell billow, and swim bark;<br />
The storm is up, and all is on the hazard!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was cited at this time a somewhat similar event in the history
of Rugby School.&nbsp; Dr. Arnold, in a like emergency, had removed
the school, or all who chose to go, in numerous detachments under the
care severally of himself and others of his masters to various distant
spots, among others his own house in the Lake country, where they spent
some two months, and returned to Rugby when the danger was over.&nbsp;
It was felt, however, that this incident furnished no real precedent
for the present venture.&nbsp; What we were proposing was not to arrange
a number of independent reading-parties <!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>in
scattered country retreats.&nbsp; Such a plan would hardly have been
practicable with a system in which, as in our case, the division of
the school for teaching purposes has no reference to the division into
boarding-houses.&nbsp; It was proposed to pluck up the school by the
roots and transplant it bodily to strange soil; to take with us the
entire body of masters, with, probably, their families, and every boy
who was ready to follow; to provide teaching for the latter, not only
without loss in the amount, but without interruption of the existing
system in any branch; and to guarantee the supply of everything necessary
for the corporate life of three hundred boys, who had to be housed,
fed, taught, disciplined, and (not the easiest of tasks) amused, on
a single spot, and one as bare of all the wonted appliances of public
school life as that yet uncertain place was like to prove, of which
the recommendation for our residence would be that no one else cared
to reside there.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The Trustees of the School met at Uppingham on March 11th.&nbsp;
This was the earliest opportunity of consulting them collectively on
the resolution to break up the school and to migrate, which had been
taken on the 7th.&nbsp; They sanctioned the breaking up of the school.&nbsp;
On the question of its removal elsewhere they recorded no opinion.</p>
<p>Meanwhile a reconnaissance was being made by one of our body, who
was despatched to visit, as in a private capacity, Borth, and two or
three <!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>other
spots on the Welsh coasts, while inquiries were also made in other directions.</p>
<p>On Monday, 13th, the Headmaster left Uppingham for a visit to the
sites which promised most favourably.&nbsp; A deep snow on the ground
made the departure from home seem the more cheerless, but it had melted
from the Welsh hills before we reached them.&nbsp; On Tuesday, the party&mdash;which
now consisted of the Headmaster, two of the staff, and one of the Trustees
(whose services on this occasion, and many others arising out of it,
we find it easier to remember than to acknowledge as they deserve)&mdash;stayed
a night at the inland watering-place of Llandrindod, one of the suggested
sites.&nbsp; The bleak moors round it were uninviting enough that squally
March day.&nbsp; But the question of settling here was dismissed at
once; there was not sufficient house-room in the place.&nbsp; So next
morning we bore down upon Borth.</p>
<p>The first sight of the place seemed to yield us assurance of having
reached our goal.&nbsp; The hotel is a long oblong building with two
slight retiring wings, beyond which extends a square walled enclosure
of what was then green turf; Cambrian Terrace overlooks the enclosure
at right angles to the hotel, the whole reminding us remotely of <!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>a
college quadrangle.&nbsp; On entering the hotel, the eye seized on the
straight roomy corridors which traverse it, and the wide solid staircase,
as features of high strategic importance.&nbsp; A tour of the rooms
was made at once, and an exact estimate taken of the possible number
of beds.&nbsp; Besides two other members of the staff, who joined the
pioneers at Borth, the school medical officer had come down to meet
us, and reported on what lay within his province.&nbsp; Meanwhile two
of the party were conducted by mine host to explore a &ldquo;cricket-ground&rdquo;
close to the hotel, or at least a plot of ground to which adhered a
fading tradition of a match between two local elevens.&nbsp; The &ldquo;pitch&rdquo;
was conjecturally identified among some rough hillocks, over the sandy
turf of which swept a wild northwester, &ldquo;shrill, chill, with flakes
of foam,&rdquo; and now and then a driving hailstorm across the shelterless
plain.&nbsp; So little hospitable was our welcome to a home from which
we were sometime to part not without regretful memories.</p>
<p>Next day, March 16th, a contract was signed, which gave us the tenancy
of the hotel till July 21st, with power to renew the contract at will
for a further term after the summer holidays.&nbsp; Our landlord, Mr.
C. Mytton, was to provide board <!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>(according
to a specified dietary) and bed (at least bed-room) for all who could
be lodged in his walls, and board (with light and firing) for the whole
party; to supply the service for the kitchen, and to undertake the laundry.&nbsp;
Servants for attendance on the boys were to be brought by the masters.&nbsp;
The payment was to be &pound;1 a head per week for all who were lodged
and boarded, or boarded only, in the hotel.&nbsp; For washing, and one
or two other matters, an extra charge was admitted.&nbsp; We have only
to add that the bargain was one with which both parties, under their
respective circumstances, had reason to be satisfied; and that the arrangement
worked not more stiffly than could be expected where the large margin
of the unforeseen left so much to subsequent interpretation.&nbsp; Even
Dido and Hiarbas were not agreed about the precise width of a bull&rsquo;s-hide.&nbsp;
We do not, however, wish it to be inferred from this classical parallel,
that our settlers claim to have rivalled the adroitness of the Punic
queen in her dealings with the barbarian prince:</p>
<blockquote><p>&alpha;&pi;&omicron;&lambda;&epsilon;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf;

</blockquote>
<p>Ten days after the reconnaissance described in the last chapter,
the pioneers of the school were again upon the ground.</p>
<p>On Monday, March 27th, a goods train of eighteen trucks, chartered
by the Uppingham masters, was unloading three hundred bedsteads, with
their bedding, on Borth platform.&nbsp; These were to be distributed
among the quarters of their respective owners, in some dozen different
<!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>houses,
which we had engaged in addition to the hotel.&nbsp; The workmen were
mostly Welshmen, anxious to be doing, but understanding imperfectly
the speech of their employers.&nbsp; With the eagerness of their temperament,
they went at the trucks, and Babel began.&nbsp; Amid a confused roar
of contradictory exhortations, with energetic gesture, and faces full
of animation and fire, they were hauling away, to any and every place,
the ton-loads of mattresses, and the fragments of unnumbered bedsteads.&nbsp;
It was time for the owners to interpose; and those of the school party
who were present, knowing that time was very precious, and that example
is better than precept, especially precept in a foreign language, put
their own hands to the work, the Headmaster being foremost, and earned
a labouring man&rsquo;s wage at unloading the trucks and carrying the
goods to their billets.&nbsp; Some of our new acquaintances watched
the scene with a shocked surprise that authorities should share in the
manual labour, instead of looking on and paying for it.&nbsp; But their
feelings at last determined to admiration.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, sirs,&rdquo;
they exclaimed, &ldquo;you get it done as if you were used to move every
three weeks.&rdquo;&nbsp; But, in fact, there was so much to be done,
and so few <!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>days
to do it in, that the exigencies of the work spared neither age, sex,
nor degree of our party.&nbsp; None were exempt, and those who were
not employed in porterage and rough carpentry might be found shifting
furniture, or stitching curtains, or jointing together bedsteads.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, workmen in and round the hotel were as busy as stage-carpenters
preparing a transformation scene.&nbsp; First, by the elimination of
carpets and furniture, the interior was reduced to a <i>tabula rasa</i>.&nbsp;
Then, in the somewhat weather-beaten top story, plastering and surface-washing
went briskly on.&nbsp; Our hosts assured us no hands could be found
for this work, but the Headmaster made a descent upon Aberystwith and
returned with the required number.&nbsp; A contractor was fitting the
large coffee-rooms, the billiard-room and others, and the ground-floor
corridor from end to end, with long narrow tables&mdash;plain deal boards
on wooden trestles&mdash;for the accommodation of three hundred diners.&nbsp;
Outside, the stables were converted into the school carpentery, and
the coach-house into a gymnasium.&nbsp; Above all, a wooden school-room,
eighty-three feet by twenty, had been designed, and its site marked
out on the north side of the enclosure behind the hotel.</p>
<p><!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>Then
there was the care of providing supplementary house-room for many purposes:
rooms for music practice, and for the boys&rsquo; studies (of which
we shall have more to say), and for hospital uses.&nbsp; Ordinary &ldquo;sick-room&rdquo;
accommodation was soon obtained by paying for it, but a fever hospital
was also a requirement which, with our experiences, we were not likely
to forget, and this was less easy to secure.&nbsp; We had to scour the
neighbourhood, knocking at the door of many a farmhouse and country
homestead, before we were provided.</p>
<p>The house-room being secured, came the labour of furnishing; the
distribution of tables, benches, bookshelves, &amp;c, for the class-rooms,
and of furniture (in many cases a minimum) for the needs of masters
and their families; the ticketing of the bed-room doors, the beds, the
chests of drawers, and each drawer in them, with the name of the occupant&mdash;with
many like minuti&aelig;, which it took longer to provide than it does
to detail them.&nbsp; The task was not rendered easier by being shared
in part with our hosts, who had hardly taken the measure of our requirements.&nbsp;
It became necessary at the last moment to telegraph to the Potteries
for a large consignment <!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>of
bed-room ware, which, in spite of protestations, had been laid in only
in half quantities.&nbsp; The world of school has marched forward since
the days when three or four basins sufficed for the toilet of a dozen
boys.</p>
<p>While the elementary needs of the colony were being attended to,
its more advanced wants were not neglected.&nbsp; There were those whom
the anxiety of providing for the school amusements, and in particular
its cricket, suffered not to sleep.&nbsp; We believe that the first
piece of school property which arrived on the scene was the big roller
from the cricket-field.&nbsp; Resolved to gather no moss in inglorious
ease at home, it had mounted a North-Western truck, and travelled down
to Bow Street station, where it was to disembark for action.&nbsp; It
cost the Company&rsquo;s servants a long struggle to land it, but once
again on terra firma it worked with a will and achieved wonders, reducing
a piece of raw meadow land in a few weeks&rsquo; space to a cricket-field
which left little to be desired.&nbsp; This meadow lay within a few
hundred yards of Bow Street station, four miles by rail from Borth.&nbsp;
It is the property of Sir Pryse Pryse, of Gogerddan, who gave the school
the use of it at a peppercorn rent.</p>
<p><!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>This
was but one of the many acts of unreserved generosity shown by this
gentleman to the school.&nbsp; It is not often that the opportunity
offers of winning so much and such hearty gratitude as our neighbour
of Gogerddan has won by his prompt liberality; still less often is the
opportunity occupied with such thoughtful and ungrudging kindness.</p>
<p>We had help in the same kind from the Bishop of St. David&rsquo;s,
who put at our service a field close to the hotel; a rather wild one,
but in which little plots and patches for a practising wicket were discovered
by our experts.&nbsp; The firm sands to the north were reported to yield
an excellent &ldquo;wicket;&rdquo; with the serious deduction, however,
that the pitch was worn out and needed to be changed every half-dozen
balls.</p>
<p>Among such cares the week rolled away only too speedily, and brought
the day of the school&rsquo;s arrival upon us.&nbsp; If we have failed,
as we have, to convey a true impression of the serious labour and anxieties
which crowded its hours, we will quote the summary of a writer who described

<p>The careful general who has completed his disposition without one
discoverable flaw, who has foreseen all emergencies, and anticipated
every possible combination, may await the action with a certain moral
confidence of success.&nbsp; But he would be a man of no human fibre,
were he not to feel some disquiet in his inmost soul when he gets upon
horseback with his enemy in sight, and listens for the boom of the first
gun.&nbsp; Not very different, except for the absence of a like confidence
<!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>in
the completeness of their dispositions, were the emotions of the masters
who manned the platform of Borth Station, when the gray afternoon of
Tuesday, April 4th, drew sombrely towards its close.&nbsp; The station
was crowded with spectators from Aberystwith and Borth itself, curious
to watch the entry of the boys.&nbsp; Expectation was stimulated by
the arrival of a train, which set all the crowd on tip-toe, and then
swept through the station&mdash;a mere goods train.&nbsp; Half an hour&rsquo;s
longer waiting, and the right train drew up, and discharged Uppingham
School on the remote Welsh platform.&nbsp; It struck a spark of home
feeling in the midst of the lonely landscape, and the chill of strange
surroundings, to see well-known faces at the windows, and to meet the
grasp of familiar hands.&nbsp; But there was no time for sentiment that
stirring evening.&nbsp; The station was cleared with all speed of boys
and spectators, the former turning in to tea at those endless tables,
the latter strolling away to carry home their first impressions of their
invaders.&nbsp; Then one group of masters and servants set to work to
sort the luggage which cumbered the platform, while others received
it at the hotel door, and distributed it to the various billets.&nbsp;
Light was scant, hands were not too numerous, <!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>and
the work was not done without some confusion.&nbsp; But it was done;
and the tired workers went to their beds, thankful for what was finished,
and full of good hopes for the work which was yet to be begun.</p>
<p>And the boys&mdash;how did they feel?&nbsp; As they stepped out from
the railway carriage into those bare, vasty corridors and curtainless
dormitories, did some little sense of desolateness in the new prospect
temper its excitement?&nbsp; Did some homesickness arise in the exile
as he pondered on the retirement and comfort of the &ldquo;house&rdquo;
at Uppingham, and his individual ownership of the separate cubicle,
and the study which was &ldquo;his castle?&rdquo;&nbsp; He was a unit
now, not of a household, but of a camp.&nbsp; Small blame to him if
life seemed to have lost its landmarks, and things round him to be &ldquo;all
nohow,&rdquo; as he sat down in some bare hall upon a schoolfellow&rsquo;s
book-box (wondering whether he should ever see his own), to while away
with a story-book the listless interval before bed-time, under the niggard
light of a smoking lamp, or a candle flickering in the draught.&nbsp;
What exactly he felt or thought, however, we do not pretend to know.&nbsp;
We only know that there was not one of them but felt proud to be out
campaigning with <!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>his
school, and would have counted &ldquo;ten years of peaceful life&rdquo;
not more than worth his share in that honourable venture.</p>
<p>There was no work for them next morning (their masters were busy
enough providing for the physical needs of the colony), and they were
free to explore their new country, to ramble up the headlands or along
the margin of the marsh.&nbsp; The arrivals of last night were but the
first instalment of the school, about half the number.&nbsp; The same
train brought in a new freight this evening, and the scene on the platform
was similar, but more tranquil.&nbsp; By a special train after midnight
came in a few more from the most distant homes, and the muster was complete.&nbsp;
The number, two hundred and ninety, fell but slightly below the full
complement of the school.&nbsp; Putting out of account the names of
those who would in any case have left the school that Easter, no more
than three, we believe, failed to follow us down to Borth.&nbsp; So
unanimous an adhesion of the school to its leaders no one had been sanguine
enough to reckon on.&nbsp; It increased no doubt at the moment the difficulties
of making provision, but withal it made the task better worth the effort.</p>
<p>Next morning the school was called together, <!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>and
the Headmaster addressed them, feeling, perhaps, somewhat like a general
publishing a manifesto to his troops before a campaign.&nbsp; It was
a great experiment, he said, in which they were sharing; let them do
their best to make the result a happy one for themselves, and for the
people among whom they had come.&nbsp; They were &ldquo;making history,&rdquo;
for this experience was a wholly new one, which might not impossibly
prove helpful some day to others in like circumstances.</p>
<p>It is pleasant to record that the appeal was not wasted.</p>
<p>At the dinner-hour to-day, the full numbers being now on the spot,
the resources of the commissariat were put to the test.&nbsp; Some anxiety
was relieved when the supply proved sufficient; it would have been small
cause for reproach if the caterers had failed in their estimate on the
first experiment.&nbsp; But of the commissariat we shall say more presently.</p>
<p>The secondary necessities of life, fire and light, were not forthcoming
with quite the same promptness.&nbsp; There was a twilight period in
many houses before lamps were furnished in sufficient abundance.&nbsp;
The place of fuel was supplied by the genial weather of the first week;
and perhaps few were aware of <!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>what
we were doing without.&nbsp; Next week the east winds and the coal arrived
together.</p>
<p>The hotel laundry found the task it had undertaken beyond its strength.&nbsp;
No wonder.&nbsp; Three hundred sets of <i>articles de linge</i> reach
a figure of which our hosts had hardly grasped the significance.&nbsp;
We are sometimes told that Gaels and Cymry cannot count.&nbsp; At any
rate, when the bales of linen came pouring in upon them, heaping every
table and piling all the floor, and still flowing in faster than room
could be found, the laundresses, brave workers though they were, felt
that the game was lost:</p>
<blockquote><p>They stand in pause where they should first begin,<br />
And all neglect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One poor nymph was discovered by a compassionate visitor dissolved
in tears over her wash-tub.&nbsp; Such misery could not be permitted;
and we transferred half the task at once to the laundries of Aberystwith.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of this day took place the distribution of &ldquo;studies.&rdquo;&nbsp;
That is to say, some sixty or eighty boys (a number more than doubled
afterwards), in order to relieve the pressure on our sitting-rooms,
were billeted upon some of the <!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>village
people, who let their rooms for the purpose.&nbsp; From two to six boys
were assigned to each room according to its capacity.&nbsp; We shall
speak again of these studies.&nbsp; Here we will only pause to thank
our good landladies for the intrepidity with which they threw their
doors open to the invasion, the more so as they mostly claimed to belong
to the category of &ldquo;poor widows&rdquo;&mdash;a qualification upon
which they were disposed to set a price in arranging their charges.&nbsp;
Their daring proved no indiscretion.&nbsp; The writer, who has the honour
of knowing them all, was the depositary of many and emphatic testimonies
on their part to the cordial relations between them and &ldquo;the children.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This endearing term was exchanged for another by one good old lady,
who appealed to him against the &ldquo;very wicked boys,&rdquo; whom
she charged with having &ldquo;foolished&rdquo; her.&nbsp; The complication
traced to ignorance of one another&rsquo;s speech (the boys spoke no
Welsh, and she would have done more wisely to speak no English), and
a <i>modus vivendi</i> was easily restored.&nbsp; Poor soul! she took
a pathetic farewell of them when their sojourn ended: &ldquo;They must
forgive her for having a quick temper; she had had much trouble; her
husband and four sons had gone down at sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Friday came a piece of cheering news.&nbsp; <!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>Some
sympathisers were intending to appeal to parents of boys in the school
for subscriptions to a fund, which should help to defray the expense
incurred by the masters in moving and resettling the school.&nbsp; The
appeal met with a liberal response in many quarters; a large sum was
raised, though from a number of subscribers smaller than the promoters
of the fund expected.&nbsp; Men, who were feeling the double pressure
at once of keen and novel cares, and of an outlay already large, which
no one could see to the end of, will not forget that well-timed succour.&nbsp;
Not least will it be remembered as a &ldquo;material guarantee&rdquo;
that the subscribers believed the cause they aided to be worth a costly
effort to save.</p>
<p>The week closed with an old scene on a new stage&mdash;a football
match on Sir Pryse&rsquo;s field at Bow Street.&nbsp; It was the last
of the house-matches, which had been interrupted at Uppingham to be
played out here.&nbsp; The sight of the school swarming into the railway
carriages, which carried us to the four-mile-distant ground, and then
the mimic war of the red and white jerseys contrasting the gray Gogerddan
woodlands which overhang the meadow, and the shouts of the English boys
blending with the excited but unintelligible cries of the Welsh <!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>rustic
children, who were rapt spectators of the game, brought home to us the
piquant contrast between our unchanged school habits and the novelty
of their framework.</p>
<p>The weather of this first week was dry and genial; and it had no
pleasanter moments than those spent on the beach at sunset, whither
the school flocked down after tea for half an hour&rsquo;s leisure in
the after-glow.&nbsp; There is plenty of amusement for them on this
broad reach of sand and shingle.&nbsp; Some are groping for shells or
for pebbles, which the lapidary will transform for a trifle into dazzling
jewels; others are playing ducks and drakes on the waves, or entertaining
themselves like Prospero&rsquo;s elves,</p>
<blockquote><p>That on the sands, with printless feet,<br />
Do chase the ebbing Neptune, and do fly him<br />
When he comes back again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More pensive spirits saunter up and down the grassy terrace which
overlooks the beach, and watch the shifting line of dark figures seen
against the white wall of the breaker, or note the fugitive tints on
the dimpling surface of the water, or the wet margin of the tide.&nbsp;
A group of villagers is clustered round the water-fountain a few yards
<!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>away;
the children chatter about us as they fill their pitchers; and the old
women, creeping homewards, cast a glance under their bonnets at the
boys, and exchange muttered comments with their gossips.&nbsp; Soon
the cliffs of the southern headland grow duskier and more remote; the
sea fades to a cold uniform gray; the colours of the brown twilight
marsh and the violet hills are lost in one another; and so, with a refreshing
breath of idyllic peacefulness, the stirring week came to an end.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Its evening closed on a quiet scene of school routine, as if
doubt and risk, turmoil and confusion and fear, weary head and weary
hand, had not been known in the place.&nbsp; The wrestling-match against
time was over, and happy dreams came down on Uppingham by the Sea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The primitive man, after he has satisfied the claims of appetite,
stitched his skin-mantle, and thatched a hut, may begin to spare time
for reflection on the quality and flavour of the prey he has eaten,
or the picturesqueness of his cabin.&nbsp; Till then his estimate of
things is quantitative.&nbsp; He asks not of what sort his food is,
but whether there is enough of it, and regards less the cut of his coat
than its thickness.</p>
<p>The analogy of our circumstances must be our excuse for postponing
so long a description of our new settlement, its physical surroundings,
and the complexion of our domestic and social life.&nbsp; Not in truth
that we had returned to barbarism: but <!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>who
could dilate on the beauty of mountain scenery, in sight of which he
was perhaps to starve; who would criticise the pattern of his dinner-service,
or be fastidious in carpets and wall-paper, before he could reckon upon
dinner, or call shelter his own?</p>
<p>But a week is over, and we have all settled into our berths.&nbsp;
The boys have found that there will be dinner every day; the masters
that no one will have to pitch his tent on a sand-dune, or spread a
straw litter in a bathing-machine.&nbsp; The level of comfort was, of
course, not uniform.&nbsp; How should it be?&nbsp; Probably there is
a choice of corners in a workhouse or casual-ward.&nbsp; Some of our
party tasted the painful pleasures of the poor in the scant accommodation
and naked simplicity of cottage lodgings.&nbsp; It was long after our
arrival that we discovered a valued friend still sitting on the corner
of his packing-case, and brewing his coffee on a washhand-stand.&nbsp;
The fire smoked all day; but this vice in the apartment was neutralised
by a broken window.&nbsp; Yet he should be quite happy, he said, if
he could get a glazier <i>and</i> a sweep (like smoke and draught, one
would not do without the other), a bolster, an occasional clean towel,
and a little warm water in the morning.</p>
<p><!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>Those
who had brought a family with them into camp were more seriously troubled
with the cares of providing quarters, and pondered regretfully on the
peace and roominess of home.&nbsp; Still as we are leaving no one houseless
or dinnerless, we may turn aside to describe at more leisure the place
we lived in and the manner of our life.</p>
<p>The stage on which our little history was enacted is a maritime plain
of irregular semicircular shape, with a sea-front of five miles, and
a depth inland of from two to three miles.&nbsp; This plain, a dead
level stretch of peat, of which part is coming under cultivation, while
part is still marsh, is surrounded by a ring of hills, which rise in
successive well-defined ranges of increasing height, till they culminate
in the summits of Cader Idris on one side and Plinlimmon on the other.</p>
<p>The River Dovey, which cleaves the circle of mountains, flows in
a broad estuary along the base of the northward hills, under which,
at the mouths of the estuary, lies the little port of Aberdovey.&nbsp;
At the other end of the arc formed by the coastline, close under the
slopes of the promontory which closes the plain at its north-west corner,
stands the village of Borth, three-quarters of a mile of straggling
dwellings, which vary in scale and <!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>character
from the primitive mud-cabin of the squatter to the stately hotel which
formed the headquarters of the school.&nbsp; The little town is irregular
even to quaintness, without being picturesque.&nbsp; Its houses are
not grouped according to size and character, but dropped as it were
anyhow, in chance collocations, tall and low, thatched and slated together.&nbsp;
Two or three gigantesque meeting-houses, featureless and sombre, domineer
over the roofs around them.&nbsp; One or two others of a less puritan
design, and not out of character with the church on a knoll a furlong
off, compensate their severer rivals.&nbsp; The shape of the village
is determined by the narrow ridge of terra firma, the mere heaping of
the tides, between the quaking marsh and the encroaching sea.&nbsp;
The nidus of the present settlement is the tiny hamlet of Old Borth,
perched on a spur of the promontory, and well out of reach of flood
tides.&nbsp; We are not sure that the mother may not outlive her colony,
unless substantial measures are taken to guard against another 30th
of January.&nbsp; Near Old Borth, through a gap in the hills, comes
the River Lery, a trout-stream known to our anglers, thanks again to
Sir Pryse who owns it.&nbsp; It races bubbling round the furze-clad
knoll, whose Welsh name is <!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>translated
Otter&rsquo;s Island, on which stands the church, and then is silenced
in a blank straight-cut channel, which conveys it through the marsh
into the estuary at Ynyslas.&nbsp; Up the gorge of the Lery runs the
railway, which carried us so often past the massive church and steep
pine-grown graveyard of Langfihangel-geneur-glyn, and across the broad
meadows of Bow Street, to the civilisation of Aberystwith.&nbsp; For
Aberystwith was our Capua, and used to draw large parties on many a
blank afternoon for marketing or amusement.</p>
<p>Then there was the beach, four miles of it, from the rocks of Borth
Head, where the waves could be watched breaking on the seaweed-covered
reef, and sending up columns of white spray against the black face of
the cliffs, away to the yellow sand dunes near the Dovey&rsquo;s mouth,
and the reaches of wet sands where we noted on summer days &ldquo;the
landscape winking through the heat,&rdquo; almost with the effect of
a mirage.&nbsp; These sands, firm and sound under foot, were a famous
walking-ground at all times; but they changed their character very much
with the seasons; at one time retreating and laying bare a beach of
shingle under the pebble ridge; at another, swinging back to cover them
up again.&nbsp; In the former <!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>state
of the shore a suggestive phenomenon might be observed.&nbsp; At low-water
mark there appeared certain dark shapeless lumps, which might be taken
for rocks at a distance, but were in fact the roots and stumps of a
submerged pine-forest.&nbsp; Remains of the same forest are found in
the marsh.&nbsp; Wood can be cut from the buried trunks, looking as
fresh in fibre as if the tree still grew.&nbsp; Here is the verification
of the legend (or is it, perhaps, the suggestion of it?) which records
the fate of the Lost Lowland Hundred.&nbsp; Once on a time (the Cymric
bards answer for it), a flourishing tract of country stretched at the
foot of the hills which are now washed by the tides of Cardigan Bay.&nbsp;
The fishermen of Borth, as they creep past the headlands in their fishing-smacks,
have seen deep down in the clear waters, the firmly-cemented stones
of a causeway, which must once have traversed the plain, and the line
of which may be not indistinctly descried stretching far out to seaward
from the mouth of a little combe.&nbsp; It is true that geologists whom
we have consulted ridicule the fancy of masonry offering such resistance
to the tides, and explain it away as a pebble-ridge built up by the
action of currents.&nbsp; And perhaps we might mention in this connection,
<!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>that
one of our party, on the first view, was half persuaded he had seen
a sea-serpent.&nbsp; Well, this prosperous country, defended against
the sea by embankments, was during the heroic age of Wales laid under
water by the opening of the sluices in a drunken frolic.&nbsp; A fragment
of it, the marsh between the pebble-ridge of Borth and the hills, would
seem to have been recovered; but it enjoys a precarious safety, and
even within our experience the sea gave a meaning threat of claiming
his own again.&nbsp; But that is a story which must be told in its own
place.</p>
<p>Such then were the geographical details of the spot in which we had
settled, and they made up a landscape, which, if it can be more than
rivalled in other parts of the Principality, has yet a characteristic
and impressive beauty.&nbsp; The following extract may serve, for lack
of a better rendering, to describe how the scene looked to the eyes
of someone who watched it on a June afternoon from the grassy slopes
of Borth Head:</p>
<blockquote><p>My eyes run on with the tide which drifts inland up the
estuary, and, farther than vision can really follow, track the march
of its glancing ripples, as they swim on past shoal and sand-dune and
morass up to the dewy gates of the Spring, in among green-clad river
meadows and crisp close-skirted woodlands which the salt breath of sea-winds
restrains from <!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>a
richer luxuriance, on past springing knolls plumed with dark firs, and
dimpling valleys mellow with the contrasted gold of the oak&rsquo;s
young leafage.&nbsp; Above these, hills moulded on a grander scale heave
up their broad shoulders to the sunlight, which is reflected in pale
but tender hues of blue or violet or rose from their bare rock masses,
or the slopes hardly less bare, which are swept by great winds, and
browsed yet closer by climbing mountain sheep.&nbsp; At this and the
other point the bosses of the hills are lighted with the sparkle of
gorse-thickets, or dusky with heather not yet kindled into bloom.&nbsp;
Lower down there are belts of woodland, fencing off the pastures which
strew the lowest terraces of the mountains from the barren wastes above
them, and these pastures are brightly flecked with patches of white-walled
homesteads down to the brown edge of the marsh.&nbsp; And so, ridge
after ridge, the hills enclose the scene in a half-circle, of which
this breezy headland, our &ldquo;specular mount,&rdquo; is an extreme
horn.&nbsp; But what the eye reposes on at last is the broad floor of
marsh-land between mountain and sea.&nbsp; A broad smooth floor, which
would be vacant and dull enough had not Nature taken thought to drape
its formlessness the more lovingly and richly.&nbsp; She has unrolled
on it a carpet of various and solemn-tinted stuffs, where pale breadths
of rusted bents sometimes mellow into strips of verdurous pasture, sometimes
deepen into belts of embrowned peat-beds, sometimes take a yellower
barrenness in parched flats, still briny and unreclaimed, and shaggy
with bristling reeds.&nbsp; It is a wilderness, but not unrelieved with
here and there an oasis, where, like islands left high and dry in a
deserted ocean bed, one and another rocky knoll lift up above the waste
flats around them some acres of sweet grass, or a broad field of flowering
mustard, shining with a splendour as of cloth of gold, and fringed with
a loop or two of silver braid by the river winding at the base.&nbsp;
There is animate life, too, sprinkled not stintedly over its surface,
not only of visitant sea-fowl from the shore, or solitude-loving creatures
native to the place&mdash;plover and duck and long-winged herons, but
also of cattle <!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>and
horses grazing on the cultivated edges of the marsh, which make us look
for the homes of their human masters at no great distance.&nbsp; Why
there they are, lying overlooked at our feet all the while, a straggle
of lowly white-roofed dwellings clinging to the long pebble ridge like
barnacles on a rock, breathing a thin smoke from their scattered chimneys,
whence the blessed smell of peat-fires is wafted through the dry air
to our nostrils.&nbsp; But one great house I notice with a crowd about
its door-steps, and a flag waving over them a device I have somewhere
seen before, where the kitchen chimney smokes with a most hospitable
volume; guests must be plenty there.&nbsp; Yes; and if further signs
of life be needed, you may listen to the puff of a farmer&rsquo;s steam-engine
planted in the swamp, and see the glitter of the steel ropes, with which
it draws its ploughshares, resistless as fate, through the oozy fallows.&nbsp;
Well, if it is come to this, the farmers and their engines will soon
civilise away the beauty of this romantic wild.&nbsp; But shall we complain?&nbsp;
If they have begun to drain these intractable marshes, then there is
a chance for other places, where the interest on the cost of drainage
will be less problematical than here.</p>

<p>From our chapter on the geographical features of our settlement we
pass on to describe how the settlers were housed and organised.</p>
<p>If a school be an institution for teaching purposes, its school-room
and class-rooms should be the most essential portion of its plant.&nbsp;
Without discussing the adequacy of the definition, we will begin with
these.&nbsp; We were not ill provided; with an exception or two, the
rooms appropriated for class-rooms answered the purpose well.&nbsp;
Some of them were spacious; the rest were large enough for the wants
of the classes, limited to an average of twenty.&nbsp; Nor would a Government
Inspector have justly measured this adequacy by the &ldquo;cubic capacity,&rdquo;
if he failed to take into account the exhilarating five minutes&rsquo;
<!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>breathing
time upon the beach, at eleven o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; There was a rare
pleasure in those moments of escape from Greek verbs to the sparkle
of the tide and the scent of the sea breeze.</p>
<p>What Germans call the &ldquo;real&rdquo; subjects, were also provided
for.&nbsp; The modern languages were taught mostly in the class-rooms
of the classical masters.&nbsp; Music took up her quarters in several
scattered dwellings.&nbsp; Wales is the home of song, and our musicians
were very welcome to make the cottage walls resound to violin or key-board.&nbsp;
We remember well the affectionate reverence with which one aged custodian
spoke of the &ldquo;pianass&rdquo; she was proud to house; she cherished
them as if they had been tame elephants.&nbsp; Several concerts were
given during our stay&mdash;but in the Assembly Rooms of Aberystwith;
our wooden school-room was found, on the first experiment, unfit for
the purpose, from the want of resonance.&nbsp; The makeshift gymnasium
and carpentery, in the stables and coach-house, have been mentioned
before.&nbsp; If among &ldquo;real studies&rdquo; we may include the
cricket, this was, as we saw, well cared for; while the instructor in
swimming had nothing to complain of, with <!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>four
miles of good beach, and the Irish Channel before him.</p>
<p>If the accommodation during school hours was adequate, it was less
easy to find elbow-room for the boys at other times.&nbsp; It was well
enough from May to August under the ample roof of blue summer weather;
but in the rainy season (and at Borth, as elsewhere, that winter was
a wet one) we should have been sorely cramped but for relief afforded
by the &ldquo;studies&rdquo; noticed in a previous chapter.&nbsp; It
is time we should describe them.&nbsp; Studies they were not, in the
sense in which the word is understood at Uppingham, where a school law
declares that &ldquo;a boy&rsquo;s study is his castle,&rdquo; and confers
upon him what Aristotle calls the &ldquo;unspeakable&rdquo; delight
of the &ldquo;sense of private property.&rdquo;&nbsp; At Borth this
could not be.&nbsp; In very rare cases was a room the one and indivisible
belonging of a single owner; often as many as six shared the table and
fireplace.&nbsp; Some of these tenements had at least the less solid
merit of looking picturesque.&nbsp; Peeping into a Welsh interior, with
its stone kitchen-floor, polished wainscoting, and oak furniture, its
walls hung with German prints of imaginative battle-pieces and Nonconforming
<!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>worthies,
and its kitchen-dresser with ranks of ancestral crockery, vivid in light
and colour, which catches the eyes first of all things through the open
door, &ldquo;This,&rdquo; one was tempted to cry, &ldquo;were the study
for me!&nbsp; Here would I sit in the shelter of the wooden screen which
keeps away draughts and noisy company, and turn the pages of my Livy
for the tale of Cincinnatus, and deeds of rustic heroes; or hear old
Horace descant on the gracious simplicity of life among the Sabines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys thought quite otherwise.&nbsp; The kitchen was generally
the last room to be chosen.&nbsp; Perhaps the idyllic attractions did
not balance the drawback of living in the thoroughfare of the house.&nbsp;
Nor could one fail to sympathise with those who preferred the garret,
a poor thing but their own, in which two studious souls could hob-nob,
or even the austere whitewash, narrow skylight, and niggard dimensions
of some monastic cell, which held just the one student, his table, and
his books.&nbsp; The editor of the School Magazine, writing a month
after our arrival, finds it &ldquo;a queer new feeling to do the old
work in a strange place, to miss the accustomed pictures on the walls,
the accustomed column of books rising on either hand&mdash;<!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>even
the familiar table-cloth and carpet, and to sit instead inside the framework
of a six-foot bed, with roof and walls forming the queerest possible
combinations of lines and angles, and hung with three different patterns
of paper.&rdquo;&nbsp; To woo the muses in a garret is the common fate
of genius; but most of the &ldquo;students&rdquo; (for so their landladies,
misled by a name, called the occupants of a study) were better off than
this literary gentleman.&nbsp; When fires came to be lighted in the
winter, there was a cheerful domesticity in the sight of the red coals,
which is unknown to the solitude of Uppingham studies, with their hot-water
pipe that warms but not exhilarates.&nbsp; In particular, one cheery
well-furnished parlour, where a blazing hearth threw its light over
the well-worn bindings of a select library brought with us from the
Sixth-Form-room, and on the well-contented faces of its two custodians,
burns as a bright spot in our memory of those winter days.</p>
<p>Thus we managed things even better than if we had listened to another
ingenious writer, with whose proposal we will close this topic.&nbsp;
It was this: &ldquo;Let two hundred bathing-machines be brought together
from Llandudno and other watering-places within reach, and ranged along
the beach.&nbsp; Let <!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>one
machine be assigned to each boy, and let them be filled up with book-shelves,
table, chairs, &amp;c.&nbsp; Thus the whole difficulty will be solved
in a moment.&nbsp; And the plan has this further advantage, that when
the time comes for returning to Uppingham, the bathing-machines would
be simply formed in line, and driven across the country to Rutlandshire,
and all further trouble in the way of furniture-vans and families-removing
be cut away at one stroke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who ought to take the command, in the event of anything happening
to your lordship?&rdquo; asked Wellington&rsquo;s officers on an occasion
in the <!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>Peninsular
War.&nbsp; &ldquo;Beresford,&rdquo; the great strategist answered, after
reflection.&nbsp; And then, in answer to their surprised looks: &ldquo;If
it were a question of handling troops, some of you fellows might do
as well, perhaps better than he; but what we now want is someone to
<i>feed</i> our men.&rdquo; <a name="citation46"></a><a href="#footnote46">{46}</a></p>
<p>This story, and the countenance of the epic and royal personages
of our mottoes, is our excuse for passing on to treat of the ignoble
topic of knives and forks, and to describe how three times a day our
colony was fed.&nbsp; It is a topic which could not be left outside
a narrative which seeks to &ldquo;show how fields were won.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If our readers will follow the master of the week as he makes his
round of the tea-tables at a quarter to seven on a winter evening, he
will witness a cheerful scene not wanting in picturesqueness.&nbsp;
The vista of the corridor is filled with three very long and very narrow
tables, and the boys of as many houses seated at them.&nbsp; The subdued
light, which streams from numerous but feeble oil-lamps through the
atmosphere of fragrant vapour steamed up by the tea-urns, falls with
Rembrandtesque contrast of light and shadow on the <!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>long
ranks of faces.&nbsp; There is that hum of quiet animation which seems
always to exhale along with the aroma of the Chinese leaf.&nbsp; From
the urn, where the house matron mounts guard up to the Sixth Form end
of the table, where the head of the house is jotting down the list of
absentees from the roll-call, the cloth is thickly studded with the
viands in tins and jars, rich and various in colour, with which the
schoolboy adds succulence to his meal.&nbsp; We open a door out of the
dim corridor, and enter a room with three more houses seated round its
walls.&nbsp; The sense of animation rises with the warmth and brightness
of the fire which roars in the grate.&nbsp; We collect the lists, and
move on to another and another room, till we have seen the last of the
eleven houses in a severely simple servants&rsquo;-hall on the basement
floor.&nbsp; Thence we return to the wind and rain outside.</p>
<p>If we came here at dinner-time, we should see the housemaster at
the head of his table, and his wife or members of his family at the
other end.&nbsp; The scene would be quite wanting in the picturesque,
but no sense of comfort would make amends for it.&nbsp; For it is dark,
especially in the centre of the corridor, and the carver of <!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>those
vast joints never knows when he will strike his elbow against the walls
or passers-by; while the incidence of draughts is clearly enough defined
by here and there a coat-collar turned up in self-defence; for neither
the glass front door, nor the wooden porch, nor our massive porter can
effectually keep out the weather.&nbsp; Dinner here is a stern bit of
the day&rsquo;s work, to be discharged with a serious fortitude.</p>
<p>We have described how we eat, but said nothing yet of what was eaten.&nbsp;
Yet our practical narrative cannot ignore the matter.&nbsp; Certain
delicate subjects, however, are best treated dialectically, and perhaps
we could not here do better than record a dialogue which we think we
must have overheard between Grumbler and Cheerful, two dramatic characters
not unknown to readers of the School Magazine some year ago:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Cheer</i>.&nbsp; Have you read that jolly letter in
<i>The Times</i>, on &ldquo;Uppingham by the Sea?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Grumb</i>.&nbsp; Yes, I have; and the writer says, &ldquo;The
commissariat was on the whole good.&rdquo;&nbsp; I must say that surprises
me.</p>
<p><i>Cheer</i>.&nbsp; Why where was it at fault, then?</p>
<p><i>Grumb</i>.&nbsp; Where?&nbsp; It was at fault all round.&nbsp;
Look at the puddings&mdash;everlastingly smoked!</p>
<p><i>Cheer</i>.&nbsp; Yes; but the commissariat is not puddings.</p>
<p><i>Grumb</i>.&nbsp; Well then, the coals&mdash;all chips and small
dust; at least, when there <i>were</i> any.</p>
<p><!-- page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span><i>Cheer</i>.&nbsp;
But the commissariat is not coals.</p>
<p><i>Grumb</i>.&nbsp; Then the cold plates your gravy froze on!</p>
<p><i>Cheer</i>.&nbsp; My good fellow, who ever heard of hot plates
on a picnic?</p>
<p><i>Grumb</i>.&nbsp; How about the vegetables then, that never came
to table except to make believe there was something in the Irish stew?
or what do you call the thing they sometimes served out for butter?</p>
<p><i>Cheer</i>.&nbsp; Ah! well! &ldquo;a rose by any other name&rdquo;&mdash;you
know the rest.&nbsp; But still, the commissariat isn&rsquo;t bad because
the butter was so sometimes.</p>
<p><i>Grumb</i>.&nbsp; Oh! of course, you can say the Commissariat (if
you spell it with a big C) doesn&rsquo;t mean the meat, or the soup,
or the puddings, or the greens, or the butter, or the coals, or the
rest of it&mdash;but if it isn&rsquo;t these, I should like to know
what it is.</p>
<p><i>Cheer</i>. (<i>loftily</i>).&nbsp; My good friend, it is easy
for you to say this thing or the other was not to your fancy, but it
was not quite so easy a matter for our landlord to provide a daily supply
of meat, bread, and dairy stuff for some four hundred people; especially
as it had to be organised for the occasion, without previous experience.&nbsp;
I take it if you knew how the farmers had to be coaxed to sell us their
butter, how green things couldn&rsquo;t be had in the markets for love
or money, and if you knew how many miles of railway those beeves travelled
to and fro between pasture, slaughter-house, and kitchen, before their
weary joints rested on our table, I say you would thank the commissariat
that you hadn&rsquo;t something worth grumbling about.&nbsp; I am glad
we never were on famine rations.&nbsp; I asked to live, not to live
well.</p>
<p><i>Grumb</i>. (<i>a trifle ashamed, but dogged</i>).&nbsp; Why, of
course, I don&rsquo;t mean to say things might not have been worse.&nbsp;
Still I stick to it, they were not nice.</p>
<p><i>Cheer</i>.&nbsp; But you&rsquo;ll admit the commissariat did its
work: the army was fed.&nbsp; After all, the proof of a pudding is <i>not</i>
the eating of it, it is how you feel after it.&nbsp; Now, people <!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>are
not starved who look the strong healthy fellows ours did when they went
home after the first term of it.&nbsp; No &lsquo;famine marks&rsquo;
in those firm, brown faces, eh?&nbsp; And then, tell me, did the Rutland
pastures ever yield such juicy mutton, or flow so abundantly with milk?</p>
<p><i>Grumb</i>.&nbsp; Enough, enough; you have it.&nbsp; Only I won&rsquo;t
be told I was revelling in comfort when I was doing nothing of the kind.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll bear it, but I won&rsquo;t grin and say I like it; I&rsquo;ll
say nothing against it if it&rsquo;s better not, but I shan&rsquo;t
say what is untrue in favour of it.&nbsp; [<i>Exeunt arm-in-arm</i>.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our two interlocutors fairly exhaust the facts of the case between
them, and the historian, who can serve no purpose by trying to think
things better or worse than they were, will silence neither.&nbsp; We
give our honest praise to the organisers of the food supply for their
effectual performance of a very heavy, vexatious, and precarious task,
the scale of which we have been brought by inquiry to estimate at its
true magnitude.&nbsp; At the same time we will spare such sympathy as
the dignity of the matter demands for the sufferers from tough beef,
tub butter, smoked puddings, cold potatoes, and congealed gravy, and
not mislead any refugee schoolmaster of the future into the belief that
he can dine in the wilderness as comfortably as in Pall Mall.</p>

<p>Housed, fed, and taught; what more does the school need done for
it?&nbsp; &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; some of the English public will
exclaim.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then you have done nothing.&nbsp; What about the
boys&rsquo; sports?&rdquo;&nbsp; We foresaw the question, and when we
left home some people felt uneasy as to what would happen to a school
separated from its fives-courts and <!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>playing-fields.&nbsp;
True, there was to be a beach, and the boys could amuse themselves by
throwing stones into the sea: but when there were no more stones to
throw&mdash;what then?&nbsp; The prospect was a blank one.</p>
<p>Well, as we have seen, things came right enough as regarded the cricket.&nbsp;
Players had to content themselves with fewer games, for the ground could
only be reached on half-holidays.&nbsp; On the other hand, the season
of 1876 gained a character of its own from the novelty of its matches
against Welsh teams.&nbsp; One of these was the eleven of Shrewsbury
School.&nbsp; With this ancient seat of learning our troubles brought
us into genial intercourse, and a few months later we met them again
on the football-field.&nbsp; Both matches were played at Shrewsbury;
in the former we gained a victory over our kind hosts, the latter was
a drawn game.</p>
<p>The athletics were held on the straight reach of road beyond Old
Borth; the steeple-chases in the fields which border it.&nbsp; At the
prize-giving, the &ldquo;champion&rdquo; was hoisted as usual, and carried
round the hotel, instead of along the <i>via sacra</i> of the Uppingham
triumph, with the proper tumultuary rites.&nbsp; For the make-believe
of paper-chases we had the realities of hare-hunting, of <!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>which
we will speak again in its season.&nbsp; Grounds for football were found
when the autumn came; the best was a meadow just below Old Borth, of
excellent turf, which dries quickly after rain; though the peaty soil,
lately reclaimed from the marsh, would quake under the outset of the
players.</p>
<p>The village boys, fired by a novel example, began to hold their own
athletics.&nbsp; One might see the corduroyed urchins scrambling down
the street in a footrace, or jerking their awkward little limbs over
a roadside ditch.&nbsp; Our boys looked on as men look at a monkey,
half amused, half indignant at the antics &ldquo;which imitated humanity
so abominably.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If we were little worse off than at home in the appliances for games,
there were other recreations which were proper to the place, and clear
gain to the immigrants.&nbsp; For example, the fishing in the Lery,
along whose banks groups of anglers might be seen strolling, whipping
the water to the full entertainment of themselves and the fish, or now
and then blessing Sir Pryse, as the angler landed his first trout from
our good friend&rsquo;s waters.&nbsp; Yet we had our old sportsmen too,
who could kill trout as well as amuse themselves, and bring home a delicate
dish for a half-holiday tea.&nbsp; For masters, <!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>there
was a little shooting to be had on the land of some friendly neighbours;
and on the no-man&rsquo;s-land of the coast, a variety of sea-fowl fell
to our guns, and were stuffed to enrich our museum with a &ldquo;Borth
Collection.&rdquo;&nbsp; We must not forget the Rink at Aberystwith,
for which parties used to be formed on half-holidays; nor the Golf,
which the long strip of rough ground along the shore tempted us to introduce.&nbsp;
The &ldquo;links&rdquo; were famous in extent and variety of ground,
but the game, in spite of patronage in high quarters, did not become
popular.&nbsp; There were also recreations of a more intellectual kind:
arch&aelig;ological visits to &ldquo;British camps,&rdquo; or others
of those Cymric monuments, which were just then provoking Lord F. Hervey&rsquo;s
incomprehensible spleen; scientific rambles in quest of rare shells,
seaweeds, or the varieties of a new flora; and rambles, half-scientific,
half-predatory, along the woody cliffs of the Lery, whence adventurers
would return with news of a hawk&rsquo;s nest discovered, but not reached,
or the more substantial result of snakes, and such venomous &ldquo;beasties,&rdquo;
captured and brought home in a bag.&nbsp; The rocks under Borth Head
were good hunting-grounds, and supplied sea-monsters for an aquarium,
which the Headmaster <!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>built
and presented to the school.&nbsp; One of the first prizes was a small
octopus, which his captor, having no other vessel handy, brought home
floating in his cap.&nbsp; In the aquarium, however, spite of this good
beginning, we have to record a failure.&nbsp; &ldquo;The masters could
not, and the boys would not, attend to it; and our best octopus, after
coming to the top of the water, and spitting a last farewell at sundry
lookers-on, died; and with him died the attempt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We are quoting from a letter of a correspondent to <i>The Times</i>,
and we cannot better conclude this part of the subject than by a graphic
paragraph from the same hand:</p>
<blockquote><p>Again, there were the birds, many always on shore and
marsh; but when the herring-fry passed up the bay the birds positively
possessed it.&nbsp; There was a wilderness of glistening wings in the
air, a restless bank of floating feathers on the sea&mdash;a mile of
wings and glancing foam of life, with many a strange wild cry, giving
the high notes to the deep bass of the waves.&nbsp; How often from the
marsh, or somewhere, dreamland or ghostland, came the plaintive wail
of the curlews; then the dotterels would run and flit about the sands;
and, not least, the herons, measuring out their dominions with their
lordly arch of wings in leisurely pride of sovereignty, passed grandly
on their way; or, ever and anon, a thousand plover, as with one soul,
would turn and glance in the sun far away.&nbsp; All this was a new
revelation to many boys, whose sole ideas of birds had been sparrows,
thrushes, perhaps, and ducks at so much a couple, and a duck-pond.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>In
our enumeration, however, of fish and fowl we had almost forgotten &ldquo;a
portent of the wave,&rdquo; which was a nine hours&rsquo; wonder with
us.&nbsp; A stray seal, revisiting the familiar shore, and unaware of
the change which had transformed his quiet haunts was encountered by
one of our party as he cruised round Borth Head in his fishing-boat.&nbsp;
We are glad to record that the <i>rencontre</i> ended without bloodshed.&nbsp;
It was a sportsman and a naturalist who had crossed the poor seal&rsquo;s
path; but he remembered that he, too, was a stranger in the land, and
he could not lift rifle against the</p>
<blockquote><p>Sea-worn face, sad as mortality,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which leaned from the ledge of rock to look at him.&nbsp; So the
monster passed on his way unharmed.</p>
<p>We have detailed at length enough of the diversions and interests
which lay close at our own doors.&nbsp; But these delights pale by the
side of those red-letter days when we went far afield to keep a holiday
among the mountains.&nbsp; We shall not see the like of those days again!&nbsp;
On such mornings, the hotel steps and the esplanade would be dotted
with anxious groups waiting for breakfast, and observing the omens of
the sky.&nbsp; If these are favourable, a little before eight a broad
stream <!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>sets
towards the station, and fills the sunny platform with a vivacious crowd.&nbsp;
Masters, who organise the several expeditions, use the interval to count
heads and sort their parties.&nbsp; The benevolent Cambrian railway
supplies spare carriages and return tickets at single fares.&nbsp; Presently
the train is sighted sliding down the winding incline from Langfihangel;
it picks us all up&mdash;near two hundred souls, it may be&mdash;moves
out into the open plain, still glittering with the morning dew, and
reaching Glandovey, drops half its passengers at the junction to explore
the northward coast, while it carries the rest to Machynlleth and Cemmes
Road.&nbsp; Here and there it sows little companies of explorers at
some mountain&rsquo;s foot or river&rsquo;s mouth.&nbsp; One band assails
Cader Idris from the rich vale of Dolgelley, and meets on the summit
another which has scaled it from Tal-y-llyn.&nbsp; Each party is convinced
that their ascent was the more creditable in point of speed, and that
they enjoyed the more magnificent views.&nbsp; One, however, claims
an advantage which can be more easily gauged; they have haled a hamper
of luncheon with them to the peak, with infinite pains.&nbsp; During
the descent this hamper (but that was after luncheon) slipped from its
carrier&rsquo;s hand, and plunged beyond recovery down <!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>the
Fox&rsquo; Walk.&nbsp; Meanwhile, others are befogged on the broad top
of Aran Mowddy, but will be anxious to explain this evening, that if
the view from the summit was lost in mist, that was more than made amends
for by &ldquo;the enchanting glimpses caught through the cloudrifts
in the descent.&rdquo;&nbsp; The day wears on, and signs of fatigue
appear.&nbsp; Some are wondering what Miss Roberts of the famous &ldquo;Lion&rdquo;
at Dolgelley has got for their dinner.&nbsp; Small boys begin to declare
that they could go on at this pace for any time you like; this is nothing
to what they did last year in the Highlands; something like mountains
<i>there</i>, you know!&nbsp; The sun is far in the west when the knot
of adventurous reconnoitrers who have gone farthest afield mount the
train at Portmadoc.&nbsp; Nearer home they thrust heads out of window
to rally their friends who join them on the poverty of their exploits.&nbsp;
These, taciturn with weariness or hunger, find they haven&rsquo;t their
best repartees at command.&nbsp; But they are all smiles and good humour
again at the news that young So-and-so, with two or three more, who
had strayed from their party, were sighted rushing along, all dust up
to their eyes, to catch the train as it moved out of the station.&nbsp;
There is no other to-night; but our good hostess, we know, will give
<!-- page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>the
youngsters tea, put them to bed, and forward them prepaid next morning.&nbsp;
At length the last station has poured in its tributary to the volume
of the returning multitude, and the train glides softly on between the
brimming estuary and the marsh golden with sunset.&nbsp; The full stream
is peaceably disgorged again through the narrow station-door, and distributes
itself along the tea-tables.&nbsp; Sleep comes down upon tired limbs
and easy consciences, and the day&rsquo;s glory throws the rich shadows
of some Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream far into the bright dawn of another
working day.</p>
<p>It was never professed that on these occasions we were doing other
than taking a holiday.&nbsp; If, together with mountain air and the
scent of heather, a boy drank in a love and understanding of Nature,
and felt, possibly for the first time, the inspiration of beauty, then
probably hours were never spent in a class-room to more profit than
were these on the slopes of Cader or Plinlimmon, or along the banks
of Mowddy.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>In our late digression on the conditions and circumstances of our
life at Borth, we have somewhat anticipated the narrative of events.&nbsp;
But it was a plan agreeable to the facts of the case, that narrative
should pass into description at the point where the stream of our little
history, after descending the rapid of alarms and difficulties, abrupt
resolves and swift action, fell quietly again into the smooth channel
of a new routine.&nbsp; Not that the story of the succeeding months
was really uneventful.&nbsp; If our readers suppose that from this point
onward <!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>we
led a prosperous untroubled existence, it will be due to the illusion,
which, in fiction, makes us cheerful over the woes of the struggling
hero, because we have glanced at the end of the book, and view the present
trouble in the light of the successful issue: what the end would be
we did not know, nor when it would come.&nbsp; And if, to resume our
metaphor, the current of the enterprise flowed for the most part smoothly,
there were rocks underneath which those who saw them could not forget,
though they seldom raised an eddy on the surface.&nbsp; Here, however,
we must ask the reader to believe us that it was so, without demanding
explanations, which at this date would be inconvenient.&nbsp; We will
go on then to notice the chief incidents of the term.</p>
<p>The wooden school-room, the slow completion of which had been watched
with some impatience, was ready for use on April 29th.&nbsp; On the
next day, being Sunday, we inaugurated it by reuniting under its shelter
our scattered congregations, hitherto distributed over the three largest
rooms at our disposal.&nbsp; It was not a noble building, being, architecturally,
a long shed of rough planks against the bowling-green wall, which was
whitewashed for the better lighting of the room.&nbsp; But it was apt
to <!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>the
conditions of a colony, looking as it did like a log-house in a backwoods-clearing.&nbsp;
Internally it was well lighted and ventilated, and just sufficient for
our numbers.&nbsp; <i>Heureusement il n&rsquo;y on a pas beaucoup</i>.&nbsp;
This was not the only occasion on which we were thankful for the school&rsquo;s
self-imposed limit of numbers.&nbsp; The completion of this poor structure
was a fact of which those who have but little knowledge of school affairs
will appreciate the value.&nbsp; It was a new burden on an embarrassed
exchequer, but not a gratuitous one.&nbsp; It is not too much to say
that the social life of the school would have been of a different and
lower stamp, and its organisation crude and ineffective, if there had
been no place of assembly where we could meet for common occasions,
for roll-call, prayers, addresses, lectures, entertainments&mdash;no
place to furnish the visible unity, which is so large an influence in
a healthy social life.&nbsp; And did the school ever feel surer of its
oneness, or more proud of its name, than when it sat on those rude benches
within the ruder walls of their makeshift great school-room?</p>
<p>The next day, May 1st, is the Uppingham Enc&oelig;nia, the commemoration
of the Chapel opening.&nbsp; It forced one to contrast the wooden walls
in <!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>which
the Saint&rsquo;s-day&rsquo;s service was held, with the high rooftree
and the deep buttresses, which this year would not echo the chanting
procession.&nbsp; The anniversary rites lapsed of necessity.&nbsp; An
accidental piece of ceremony marked this day; for that morning a flagstaff
was erected on the terrace in front of the hotel, and a flag run up,
by the lowering of which the hour of dinner or roll-call could be signalled
to ramblers on the shore or the hill.&nbsp; On the 19th of the month
we hoisted with much cheering our own colours: a banner, on which some
of the ladies had worked the Founder&rsquo;s device, the antique schoolmaster
and his ring of scholars.&nbsp; The flags (there were three in all)
were carried home with us, and the faded and tattered folds which had
fought with the sou&rsquo;-wester, now droop in a graceful canopy at
one end of the great school-room.</p>
<p>By the middle of June the new church of Borth, so opportunely built
in time for our settlement, was declared ready.&nbsp; It was courteously
placed at our disposal for two services on Sunday before the hours of
the parish services.&nbsp; The building exactly held us, with a little
pinching.&nbsp; The first occasion of our using it was a confirmation
held by the Bishop of St. David&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The <!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>Bishop,
whose early connections are with this neighbourhood, and who had already
in his capacity of landowner given us proof of his goodwill, seemed
to rejoice in the occasion of expressing his sympathy with the immigrants
into his quiet home.&nbsp; The kindness of the visit was not slight;
for the journey, to and fro, from difficulties of transport, demanded
two days.&nbsp; We have the more reason to be grateful for his willing
sacrifice of time, because, in view of the interval since the last confirmation
and of the long sojourn in Wales before us, we should otherwise have
suffered a kind of mitigated excommunication.</p>
<p>June 29th and 30th were the days of the &ldquo;Old Boys&rsquo; Match,&rdquo;
the annual reunion of the Past and Present School.&nbsp; There seemed
no reason why absence from our native soil should sever our ties with
the Past.&nbsp; Quite the contrary.&nbsp; <i>Ubi C&aelig;sar ibi patria</i>,
thought our Old Boys, who, indeed, never before felt so glad to claim
their heritage in the fortunes of Uppingham.&nbsp; The game, which was
like other games of cricket, and need not be described, was played on
the Gogerddan field, where the Headmaster, in lieu of his customary
supper, not practicable at Borth, gave a luncheon each day.&nbsp; On
the first day, as the company rose from <!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>table,
a signal was given to the school to draw up to the tent, outside which
the guests were standing.&nbsp; They formed a kind of hollow square
to see what would happen, and an old Uppinghamian (Mr. R. L. Nettleship,
Fellow of Balliol College, Oxford) came forward and presented an &ldquo;Address
from the Old Boys at Oxford, to the Headmaster and Masters of Uppingham
School.&rdquo;&nbsp; He noticed briefly the circumstances under which
it had been drawn up, explaining why (through lack of time to concert
matters with the sister university) it had come from Oxford only, and
added that they hoped shortly to give something more substantial than
parchment.&nbsp; &ldquo;What they could offer was a slight thing, it
was true, yet one which their old Headmaster and his coadjutors would
not think valueless.&rdquo;&nbsp; He proceeded to read the address,
which ran thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We, the undersigned old members of Uppingham School,
now resident at Oxford, write to express our deep sympathy with the
Headmaster and Masters of Uppingham School in the great difficulties
with which they have lately had to contend.&nbsp; Feeling as we do,
that though we have left the school, we still, in the truest sense,
belong to it, we can but testify our gratitude <!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>to
those whose courage and skill have carried it safely through such a
crisis, and converted a great misfortune into a proof that it is strong
enough to defy accidents.&nbsp; Our confidence in the Headmaster is,
as always, entire and unabated, and we are sure that the school which
he has so successfully led to Borth will come back under the same leadership,
with its vigour undiminished, to its home at Uppingham.&rdquo; <a name="citation66"></a><a href="#footnote66">{66}</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In reply the Headmaster said, addressing himself to the memorialists
and the school, &ldquo;the past and future (for what we are doing has
a past and future), I thank you for this with all my heart, for this
which you call &lsquo;a slight thing.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is a slight thing;
but yet, like a flag which armies have rallied round and have died for,
it can give spirit and endurance and confidence.&nbsp; Yes, it is true,
as you say, that these have been hard times, as those know who have
had day by day to watch ruin coming closer <!-- page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>and
closer, with no hope, no room for escape.&nbsp; Like men in the story
tied to the stake in front of the advancing tide, we had to see wave
on wave coming up to bring a slow but sure destruction.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then, after speaking of the incidents which ended in our coming to this
spot, he continued: &ldquo;We have been brought by our troubles much
before the eyes of the public.&nbsp; They speak of &lsquo;the fierce
light that beats upon a throne,&rsquo; but that is hardly so intolerable
as the fierce light that beats upon a great calamity.&nbsp; Yet I trust
that fierce light may prove to the school a refining fire.&nbsp; Certainly
the present school has behaved worthily under their novel circumstances;
they have shown themselves true sons of Uppingham.&nbsp; You of the
past school see round you your successors, and you may be proud of them;
at least we have suffered no trouble through those you see before you
here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The end of all this which of us knows?&nbsp; But we have faith
that it shall be good.&nbsp; Though all seems to fail and perish, all
our work to die, yet I am sure there shall be no real death of the life
of the school, but that it shall have its resurrection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words were meant for the ears to which <!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>they
were addressed.&nbsp; If to readers remote from the facts and the feeling
of the hour they perhaps strike a note of scarcely intelligible emotion
yet our story cannot spare them.&nbsp; To us who heard them they were
an expressive summary of many thoughts, and fears, and hopes of that
time, which our narrative cannot give expression to otherwise than in
this indirect fashion.&nbsp; Had those thoughts and hopes been other,
we should not, perhaps, have had this story to tell.</p>
<p>The choir gave an <i>al fresco</i> concert on the night of the second
day of the match in the grass close.&nbsp; The resonance from the surrounding
buildings made the songs very effective for an outdoor entertainment.</p>
<p><i>Surgit amari aliquid</i>.&nbsp; Just at this time came news of
a new fever case at Uppingham.&nbsp; We knew what might be the significance
of the news, and began to make up our minds for another term at Borth.</p>
<p>On July 5th a public concert was given by the choir, and attended
by the rest of the school, at Aberystwith.&nbsp; It was the second of
two given in support of the new church at Borth, to the debt on which
the proceeds were devoted.&nbsp; The first was held in the Assembly
<!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>Room
of the Queen&rsquo;s Hotel, a beautiful room, with fine acoustic properties.&nbsp;
We cannot say as much for the Temperance Hall, in which the second was
given.&nbsp; It is a structure of the very severest Georgian architecture.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; asks a reporter, &ldquo;should water-drinkers allow
it to be supposed that the graces of art are all in the hands of Bacchus?&rdquo;&nbsp;
The journey to and fro by rail was, in the popular estimate, an integral
part of the entertainment; its charm lay in the uncertainty as to whether
the laden train would be able to climb the abrupt incline to Langfihangel,
or would keep on the rickety rails as it spun down the same curve in
returning.&nbsp; Otherwise, that the school should make a railway journey
<i>en masse</i> to hold an evening concert seemed, under our nomad conditions,
to be only in the common course of things.</p>
<p>One concert we held in the wooden school-room on the 22nd of May;
on that occasion (we quote the magazine&rsquo;s reporter) &ldquo;All
the members of the choir might be seen flocking to the school-room,
with candle and candlestick in hand, to furnish light for the performance.&nbsp;
The candles were arranged in sevens on wooden shelves all down the sides
of the room, and though the <!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>whole
spectacle had its laughable side, as most things have, the general effect
was far from bad.&nbsp; It was cheerful enough; in fact, only a Christmas-tree
and some more disorder was needed to turn the entertainment into as
good an imitation of a happy school-treat as you would get at a day&rsquo;s
notice.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the music sounded dully in the timber walls,
and the experiment was not repeated.</p>
<p>Meanwhile a new inroad of care had for the last fortnight, since
the late news from Uppingham, disquieted the colony.&nbsp; Major Tulloch,
a Government Inspector, who, on behalf of the Local Sanitary Board,
had reported on the state of the town of Uppingham, had expressed a
strong opinion that the school ought not to return thither before Christmas.&nbsp;
In consequence of this a memorial was sent from the masters to the Trustees,
requesting them to reverse their decision of June 17th, which recalled
the school in September.&nbsp; At a meeting of the Trustees, on July
14th, the following resolution was passed:</p>
<blockquote><p>Resolved&mdash;&ldquo;That, while in the opinion of the
Trustees there is nothing in the present condition of the town of Uppingham
which calls upon them to rescind their resolution of the 17th ult, yet,
<!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>having
regard to a memorial addressed to them by the whole body of the assistant-masters,
they are willing, in compliance with the same, that the school shall
remain at Borth during the autumn term.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Arrangements were at once begun for returning to camp after the holidays.&nbsp;
The responsibility for this step, which was thus devolved upon the masters,
though it was accepted without hesitation, was felt to be no light one.&nbsp;
Our engagement with the lessee of the hotel had provided for a renewal
of the contract at will; but there remained the owners of some thirty
houses, large and small, with whom we should have to reckon.&nbsp; They
would have us in their hands, and might, if so minded, &ldquo;turn our
necessity to glorious gain.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, too, many of the lodging-houses,
excellent as airy summer pavilions, did not promise much comfort in
winter time, to those who remembered how in the spring weeks the curtains
and everything movable within doors</p>
<blockquote><p>Fluttered in the besieging wind&rsquo;s uproar,<br />
And the long carpets rose along the gusty floor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moreover, natives who knew, threatened us with rain all day and every
day, from the beginning <!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>of
September till the end of October, after which it would be dry.&nbsp;
Others, who also knew, promised us fine weather till the latter date,
and then wet till Christmas.&nbsp; Putting the two assurances together,
one inferred that weather at Borth would be like weather in general.&nbsp;
However, in prospect of winds and wet, the open porch of the hotel was
walled up with planks so as to put another door between the sou&rsquo;-wester
and the diners in the corridor.&nbsp; Also a long lean-to shed, like
a cloister without windows, was run along two sides of the bowling-green
wall.&nbsp; The outlay on the latter yielded no adequate return.&nbsp;
It afforded some shelter for chapel roll-call, and for the few minutes&rsquo;
lounge before evening prayers, except when it rained hard enough, and
then the water poured through the contractor&rsquo;s felt roof.&nbsp;
It was too narrow to be used, as was hoped, for games; unless, indeed,
we had turned it into a skittle-alley.&nbsp; But then skittles is a
game of low connections.&nbsp; Finally, well-wishers were solemn in
their warnings that the drainage of the spot was defective (which, indeed,
was no otherwise than true, till we brought about a reform), and that
our settlement by the sea was nothing if it was not healthy.</p>
<p>The outlook then was not unclouded.&nbsp; But one <!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>bright
day we had before we said good-bye to the past, and fronted the future
cares.&nbsp; Sir Pryse had invited the school to spend a day with him
at Gogerddan, Thursday, July 20th, the last day of term.&nbsp; Room
was found for all his guests to dine together in a large barn near the
house, where, from the high and narrow windows, the light fell in picturesque
mellowness on the close-packed ranks.&nbsp; A match was played in the
grounds between the school and an Aberystwith eleven; the rest whiled
away the afternoon right pleasantly among the flowers and grass-slopes.&nbsp;
At a pause in the game there was a gathering on the lawn to watch the
execution of a little surprise which the cricketers had prepared for
our host.&nbsp; From a box which had been perilously smuggled in, was
produced a memorial gift (it consisted of a study-clock and inkstand),
which &ldquo;the cricketers of Uppingham begged Sir Pryse to accept,
as a slight acknowledgment of his special liberality to themselves;&rdquo;
for so it was set forth in an address which the captain of the eleven
proceeded to read to him.&nbsp; Our host, as much startled as if the
present and the address had been shot at him out of a cannon, answered
in a brief but not the less effective speech.&nbsp; Then, as if to relieve
the warmth <!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>of
feeling generated between us, a piano was run into the bow of an open
window, and the choir outside delivered themselves of some hearty music.&nbsp;
Soon the evening train was carrying us home for the reading of the class-list
and the prize-giving.&nbsp; In the customary address, the Headmaster
could congratulate the school on having borne themselves well during
the great time in the school&rsquo;s history which this day brought
to a close: he called on them to &ldquo;come back with the soldier spirit&rdquo;
to face whatever remained.</p>
<p>There was dark work going on in the street that night.&nbsp; When
dawn broke, it disclosed an array of flags, streamers, and devices,
along the approach to the station, where &ldquo;the special&rdquo; was
waiting.&nbsp; Prominent among the devices was the motto, <i>Au revoir</i>.&nbsp;
For the feeling it spoke, all were grateful; but not all rejoiced in
the occasion of it.&nbsp; The train moved out of the station with the
school, to a boy, on board of it, to the sound of a farewell cheer,
and so the curtain fell on the first act of the play.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>September 15th and 16th were the days of the school&rsquo;s return
to Borth.&nbsp; We slipped at once and easily into the groove of last
term&rsquo;s routine, filling our old quarters and several additional
houses.&nbsp; Some building operations needed for the winter&rsquo;s
sojourn have been mentioned by anticipation.&nbsp; Our medical officer,
also, and the ready pickaxe of &ldquo;Sanitary Tom&rdquo; (as the boys
called the navvy <!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>who
was his stout ally), had been at work laying bare the subterranean geography
of our premises and making all right.&nbsp; At his instance, the proprietor
ran out an extended culvert into the sea beyond low-water mark, a grand
engineering work, which remains the one permanent monument of our settlement.&nbsp;
Having in mind some ancient aspersions on the wholesomeness of Borth
we are glad to bear testimony to the present adequate sanitation of
the place.</p>
<p>We do not write for the scientific, and yet we must notice (we hope
without wounding an unprofessional ear) the beautiful economy of natural
forces by which that sanitation is effected.&nbsp; The channel of the
Lery, between which and the sea the hotel is built, runs parallel to
the coastline, till it meets at right angles the estuary of the Dovey.&nbsp;
The same tide which washes the beach also fills the Lery channel and
the adjoining ditches.&nbsp; When the ebb has set in the water in the
latter stands for a time at a higher level than on the beach.&nbsp;
Reflecting on this, our engineers cut a duct between the Lery and the
sea, so as to draw the water from the river down the main drainage artery,
performing twice daily a most effective flushing.</p>
<p><!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>Some
of us would have preferred to leave a more dignified memorial of ourselves,
forgetting, perhaps, that it is a Cloaca which is the most impressive
witness to the civilised resources of an ancient king.&nbsp; So an offer
was made to the proprietors that, if they would find the tools and directors
of the work, the school would provide the labourers for the making of
a road between the village and the church, an interval of a furlong
of marshy land, bridged at that time by a makeshift causeway.&nbsp;
They did not, however, see their way to accept our amateur industry,
and the project fell through.</p>
<p>With the arrival of the boys came also news, that on the day before,
September 14th, the engineers had broken ground at Uppingham:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ea vox audita laborum</i><br />
<i>Prima tulit finem</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We had waited not without some impatience for the first sound of
the pickaxe; and its echoes were welcomed as promising an end to our
exile.</p>
<p>The new term opened smilingly.&nbsp; The smooth working order into
which everything fell at once contrasted pleasantly with the anxious
bustle of the entry in April.&nbsp; A glorious autumn was settling <!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>on
the hills, draping them from head to foot with a red mantle of the withering
bracken, which slowly burnt itself out along their slopes.&nbsp; There
was sun and daylight enough for many rambles along old paths or new
ones before the year was fairly dead.</p>
<p>Our prosperity was suddenly staggered.&nbsp; Just five weeks after
the return a case of scarlet fever occurred, followed in the course
of the week by half-a-dozen more.&nbsp; An outbreak of this kind is
too common an incident in a large school to merit much surprise or great
alarm.&nbsp; But then our circumstances were exceptional.&nbsp; If the
infection spread, it might be difficult to find hospital room; to communicate
it to the villagers, as might easily befall, would be an unhappy return
for their own ready hospitality; and then how miserable to have fled
from sickness at Uppingham, and find it had followed us to Borth, as
if, like the haunted family of the poem, &ldquo;we had packed the thing
among the beds.&rdquo;&nbsp; Already there came news which raised unspoken
doubts of our returning home after Christmas.&nbsp; How, then, if we
could not stay here?&nbsp; The question was hard to answer.</p>
<p>It is, however, a well-recognised fact that epidemics of this kind
are very much under the <!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>control
of scientific precautions, and as we had good advice on the spot, no
time was lost in stamping out the plague.&nbsp; War is not made with
rose-water (it certainly was not rose-water which reeked along our passages),
and fever germs can be exterminated, it seems, by nothing less exasperatingly
unsavoury than carbolic acid, an agency which was laid on without any
ruth.&nbsp; Grumblers were offered the alternative of being smoked with
sulphur.&nbsp; Some complained of sore throats, contracted, they said,
from the fumes of the disinfectant, and declared that the remedy, like
vaccination, was only a mitigated form of the disorder.&nbsp; The landlords
of our studies looked on with irresolute wonder, when some of us sprinkled
their floors with a potent decoction poured from watering-pots.&nbsp;
Most of them regarded it as a kind of magical rite into which it would
not be seemly to inquire.&nbsp; In one house a practical seaman, late
home from a cruise, took a less reverent view of the lustration, and
uttered hints of what he would do to the perpetrators&rsquo; heads if
their acid touched his carpets again.&nbsp; Probably the best disinfectant
applied was the clear strong wind, which ten days after the first case
succeeded the previous relaxing weather.&nbsp; All windows and <!-- page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>doors
were ordered wide open for the free passage of the blast; and the boys
were directed to bring down their rugs, great-coats, and dressing-gowns,
and anything of the kind which might be supposed to harbour mischief,
and spread them for purification on the pebbles of the beach.&nbsp;
It will be believed the scene was a quaint one, however it might remind
the scholar of the idyllic laundry scene by the Ph&aelig;acian shore,
where Nausicaa and her maidens:</p>
<blockquote><p>&epsilon;&pi;&epsilon;&iota; &pi;&lambda;&upsilon;&nu;&alpha;&nu;
&tau;&epsilon; &kappa;&alpha;&theta;&eta;&rho;&alpha;&nu; &tau;&epsilon;
&rho;&upsilon;&pi;&alpha; &pi;&alpha;&nu;&tau;&alpha;<br />

&alpha;&pi;&omicron;&pi;&lambda;&upsilon;&nu;&epsilon;&sigma;&kappa;&epsilon;
&theta;&alpha;&lambda;&alpha;&sigma;&sigma;&alpha;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whether it was these purgations, or the fumes of the carbolic which
exorcised the infection, or whether the pest was starved out by the
immediate and careful isolation of the cases that occurred, we must
leave doctors to determine.&nbsp; It is certain that the epidemic came
to an end in less than ten days after the first case.&nbsp; That we
were able to apply the most necessary of measures, that of isolating
at once all cases declared or suspected, we owe to the readiness of
the villagers to put house-room at our service, a readiness on which
we certainly had no right to calculate.&nbsp; The rent we might pay
<!-- page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>them
was no measure of the service rendered.&nbsp; If a panic had closed
their doors, our situation would have been worse than critical.</p>
<p>The cause of the outbreak could not be confidently assigned, but
since the most probable theory traced it to a recent railway excursion
made by some school parties, these expeditions were discontinued for
a time.&nbsp; This was no great privation, for the year was closing
in.</p>
<p>About this time, October 16th, the appointment of new &ldquo;Pr&aelig;postors&rdquo;
was made, to fill up vacancies in the body.&nbsp; In speaking as usual
on the occasion, the Headmaster called attention to the experiment in
self-government which our special circumstances were affording.&nbsp;
There would be little reason for our recording the occasion, were it
not that since that date the monitorial system in public schools has
been canvassed in the Press, on occasion of an untoward incident of
recent notoriety, and has been described by some as the parent of the
&ldquo;grossest tyranny,&rdquo; ruinous to the future of any school
from which the institution is inseparable.&nbsp; We had thought this
view of the system obsolete, or correct only of schools subject to obsolete
conditions.&nbsp; If we were mistaken, it may be <!-- page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>worth
while to record an experience which tends to a less pessimistic conclusion.</p>
<p>It will easily be understood that the mechanical organisation of
the school was greatly deranged by the removal from home.&nbsp; The
boys of the several houses were no longer locally separated, nor in
the same immediate contact with their housemasters; they were restrained
by few bolt-and-bar securities, &ldquo;lock-up&rdquo; being for the
most part impracticable, and were allowed a larger liberty in many less
definable ways.&nbsp; At the same time they were exposed to no little
discomfort, and during the rainy months to much monotony, the very conditions
which promote bullying and other mischief.&nbsp; Further, the same causes
which reduced the control of masters, also embarrassed the upper boys
in their monitorial duties.&nbsp; Thus the school was left in a quite
unusual degree to its self-government, and that government had to act
at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>Yet the result was that all went well.&nbsp; The boys did not bully
one another, and they gave their masters no sort of trouble.&nbsp; Old
rules had to be relaxed, because they could not be enforced, but no
licence came of it; new rules <!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>had
to be made, which might seem vexatious and not very intelligible restrictions,
but there was no tendency to break them.&nbsp; Of course wrong things
were done at Borth as elsewhere; but if we were to record the few misdeeds
which occur to us, their insignificance would provoke a smile; while
we have good evidence for the belief that the rate of undetected offences
was not increased.</p>
<p>These are the facts we have to record.&nbsp; Different explanations
will suggest themselves to others, but among observers on the spot there
was but one opinion&mdash;that the prosperous result was due to the
system of self-government, &ldquo;monitorial system,&rdquo; or whatever
we name the institution, which rests on the assumption that English
boys are capable of responsibility and authority, and will prove trustworthy
if their masters are willing to trust them.&nbsp; We do not forget that
other factors entered into the cause; one which cannot be ignored was
the consciousness of the boys that the school was on its trial, and
that a public one.&nbsp; But people cannot acquire self-control merely
by the removal of restraints, or behave well, for a long time together
and in spite of tedium, simply because <!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>they
would like to do so.&nbsp; The truth is, that in a time which might
have been anarchical, we lived on the fruits of a long-established order;
and it is fair to add that at the end of thirteen months there were
no visible symptoms that discipline was wearing threadbare.</p>
<p>Shall we, for writing this, be taxed with the vain-glory for which
public schools are at times reproached?&nbsp; We must brave the charge,
then; for the facts seem to furnish evidence of a kind so rarely obtainable,
that to omit them from this chapter in school life would be hardly excusable.&nbsp;
An experiment so crucial as that to which we were submitted does not
occur once in fifty years.</p>
<p>But enough of serious matters.&nbsp; Let us go out and forget them
in a run with Sir Pryse&rsquo;s harriers, along the breezy gorse-covered
downs of the Gogerddan estate.&nbsp; We take the train which arrives
just after we have risen from dinner, and land at the upland village
of Langfihangel.&nbsp; It is a Saturday afternoon, the 21st of October,
the day is clear and sunny, and several ladies are of the party.&nbsp;
A few hundred yards from the station we met the hounds, and Sir Pryse&rsquo;s
man who hunts them.&nbsp; The owner is not with them, but (by his <!-- page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>good
leave) yonder tall, lithe fellow, the best runner in the school, acts
as Master of Hounds.&nbsp; He promises us good sport, having heard from
the huntsman of a hare which is &ldquo;waiting for us.&rdquo;&nbsp;
As they prepare to cast off, the non-effectives separate from the runners,
and climb a round-topped hill which commands the country.&nbsp; The
fields are spread like a map under us; nothing on the face of the country
escapes our eyes.&nbsp; The hare that was &ldquo;waiting for us&rdquo;
has grown tired of it, and left the rendezvous, but another is soon
started, and a stout one.&nbsp; She is of the mountain breed, as are
many in this country; they could not otherwise have held out so long
before the pursuit of such runners, to say nothing of the hounds.&nbsp;
The &ldquo;tally-ho&rdquo; comes cheerly up to us from the valley through
the crisp October air, and we see puss scudding along up the hedgerow,
the hounds and the foremost runners in the next field, the rest thinning
out and straggling behind them.&nbsp; Among these we recognise with
glee a friend or two, who years ago were in the first flight of every
Uppingham paper-chase (<i>si nunc foret illa uventus</i>), labouring
across a turnip-field, or held by the leg in a gorse-cover.&nbsp; A
check gives them a chance of coming up again with huntsman and <!-- page 86--><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>master.&nbsp;
We won&rsquo;t spoil the chance by halloing where the hare went, though,
from our vantage-ground, we can view her throughout.&nbsp; Our friends
have just got in line with the leaders, and are finding their breath
again for a second burst, when the scent is recovered; the chase sweeps
up the ridge, and over it out of our sight, away, perhaps, towards the
moorland spurs of Plinlimmon.&nbsp; We descend the hill homewards, leaving
puss to her doom, whatever it may be.&nbsp; For these runs sometimes
had a fatal termination.&nbsp; In the school serial is told the story
of a magnificent day, of which, however, the runners did not witness
the end, for &ldquo;time was drawing late, and we were far from the
station, so had to leave the hounds under the charge of the huntsman
alone, and as the hare was now exhausted, they soon killed her.&nbsp;
We were on the scent for over two hours, and ran about twelve miles.&rdquo;&nbsp;
These days took place two or three times a week; for good practical
reasons the &ldquo;field&rdquo; was restricted in numbers.</p>
<p>After the short and sharp battle with the scarlet fever narrated
above, the term went on very peacefully, but with a growing expectation
that this would not be the last one in Wales.&nbsp; <!-- page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>News
from Uppingham of the unpreparedness of the place to receive us left
little room for doubt, but the question was not decided (at least, officially)
even at the date of the break-up.&nbsp; The prospect of a fresh period
of makeshift life was not a welcome one; but the worst had been faced
by this time, and found, after all, not hard to deal with.&nbsp; The
long dark evenings of November proved a less difficulty than was anticipated.&nbsp;
With afternoon school shifted to the hour of sunset, and with meetings
of the Debating and other societies on half-holiday evenings, the dark
hours did not hang heavily, and the expected tedium of an Arctic winter
was not experienced.&nbsp; The term closed with a concert given in the
Assembly Room at Aberystwith, December 13th, and another on the next
night in the Temperance Hall at popular prices.&nbsp; On the 14th, a
team of Old Boys played the usual football match against the Present
School, and were beaten by two goals to one.&nbsp; That evening the
class-list was read and the prizes given.&nbsp; If the boys hoped to
gather from the Headmaster&rsquo;s speech an intimation of where they
would meet him after Christmas they were disappointed.&nbsp; The government
had as yet no <!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>communication
to make.&nbsp; Next morning, in the darkness before dawn, the special
train carried them to their homes, to await with curiosity their next
marching orders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;England, when she goes to war,&rdquo; said a Prime Minister
not long ago, &ldquo;has not to consider whether she will be able to
fight a second or a third campaign.&rdquo;&nbsp; We remembered that
we were Englishmen; and on January 19th, 1877, went down again with
a good courage for our third campaign on the Welsh coast.&nbsp; A furious
gale was howling that day among the hills of Cardiganshire, recalling
to the memory of some of us the stormy Ides of March, when the pioneers
of our little army first set foot in Borth.&nbsp; <i>Omina principiis</i>
<!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span><i>inesse
solent</i>.&nbsp; This gale was sounding the key-note of the term&rsquo;s
adventures.</p>
<p>The cause of our return to Borth for a third term is briefly told.&nbsp;
We had gone home at Christmas, uncertain whether we should meet again
there or at Uppingham.&nbsp; Dr. Acland, of Oxford, to whose active
sympathy with the school in its perplexities we must at least gratefully
allude, had undertaken on our behalf to inspect the sanitary condition
of Uppingham, and give us his judgment on the expediency of reassembling
there.&nbsp; His judgment was submitted to the attention of the Trustees
at their meeting, on December 22nd, when it was resolved that, &ldquo;In
the face of Dr. Acland&rsquo;s report, the Trustees deeply regret they
cannot at present recall the school to Uppingham.&rdquo;&nbsp; So we
went back to the sea.</p>
<p>Our numbers this term just missed by one the normal total of three
hundred.&nbsp; In the two preceding terms they had been smaller by some
five or six.&nbsp; The camp at Borth, therefore, had not suffered from
want of recruits.&nbsp; Indeed, it was now foreseen that the return
to Uppingham would be for about one-third of the school a first arrival
there.</p>
<p><!-- page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>The
beginning of the end of our exile seemed to be marked by the reduced
number of masters&rsquo; families in camp.&nbsp; Some had gone into
winter quarters at Aberystwith; some had already resettled at Uppingham.&nbsp;
Our connection with home began to be retightened also by parochial and
other common transactions, in which we took our share from a distance.&nbsp;
Not, indeed, that the connection had ever been discontinued.&nbsp; We
had left too precious pledges behind us.&nbsp; The deserted gardens
did not waste all their sweetness on the air which we had exchanged
for a &ldquo;fresher clime.&rdquo;&nbsp; A thin intermittent stream
of their products found its way along the nine hours of railway through
most of the year.&nbsp; Flowers, fruit, and vegetables might raise tantalising
memories of the pleasant places where they grew, but were not the less
welcome to dwellers in this somewhat austere tract where they did not
grow or grew very niggardly.&nbsp; The traffic in these delicacies drew
the attention of the London and North-Western Railway Company, whose
officials called to account one of our servants for travelling with
an excess of personal luggage.&nbsp; The artless contrabandist, besides
his own modest pack, had fourteen several hampers and boxes under his
charge.&nbsp; This <!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>was
checked.&nbsp; But who was the miscreant who systematically staved in
and pounded into such odd shapes the little tin boxes in which our rose-fanciers
had their choice blooms sent them by post?&nbsp; Post Office authorities
thought the damage was caused by &ldquo;the pressure of the letters.&rdquo;&nbsp;
We did not, and remonstrated, till the practice, whoever was the criminal,
was stopped.&nbsp; Besides these gracious souvenirs of home, there were
from time to time business matters which we had to transact as parishioners
and ratepayers.&nbsp; One was sensible of an almost humorous contrast,
when we discussed our interests in the Midlands in a room overlooking
the coast and hills of Cardiganshire, where one turned from watching
the waves breaking crisply on the beach, to study a map of some property
in Rutland pastures.&nbsp; It has been accounted a signal proof of Roman
self-confidence, that bidders could be found for a piece of land on
which Hannibal was encamped at the moment of sale.&nbsp; The situations
are not quite parallel.&nbsp; But people who could seriously debate,
as we did, on the purchase of a freehold at a time when not even their
Rome was their own, clearly had not despaired of their country.</p>
<p><!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>With
the exception of the moving incidents to be immediately narrated, the
tale of this term&rsquo;s life differs little from that of the preceding.&nbsp;
The round of work and play was much the same; the harriers were out
again, football went on as before, till superseded by the &ldquo;athletics,&rdquo;
and a match was played on March 7th against Shrewsbury School on their
ground, of which the result was a drawn battle.</p>
<p>Our difficulties this term were with the elements.&nbsp; In novels
of school life, where the scene is laid on the coast, the hero always
imperils his bones in an escapade upon the cliffs.&nbsp; The heroes
of our romance knew what was expected of them.&nbsp; Accordingly, two
new boys of a week&rsquo;s standing start one afternoon for a ramble
on Borth Head and are missing at tea-time.&nbsp; Search parties are
organised at once (it was not the first occasion, for the writer remembers
sharing in a wild-goose chase which lasted four hours of the night,
along and under the same cliffs); while one skirted the marsh to Taliesin,
another explored the coast.&nbsp; The latter party at nine o&rsquo;clock
in the evening discovered the involuntary tenants perched upon a rock
a little way up the cliff.&nbsp; They had climbed to it to escape <!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>the
tide which had cut them off, and here they sat, telling stones in turn,
they said, to while away the time till the tide should retire.&nbsp;
Before the waters went, however, darkness came; and either from fear
of breaking bones in the descent or suspicion of some fresh treachery
in the mysterious sea, they clung to their perch, blessing the mildness
of a January night without wind or frost, but blessing with still more
fervency the lanterns of their rescuers.&nbsp; They had passed five
hours in this anxious situation.</p>
<p>This was the sportive prelude of more serious trouble.&nbsp; <i>Nunquam
imprudentibus imber incidit</i>: as the servant perhaps reflected, who,
on Monday, January 29th, was conveying the dinner of his master&rsquo;s
family from the Hotel kitchen to Cambrian Terrace.&nbsp; As he crossed
the gusty street between them, the harpies of the storm swept the dinner
from dish, and rolled a prime joint over and over in the dust.&nbsp;
A leg of mutton was following, but he caught it dexterously by the knuckle-end
as it fell, and rescued so much from the wreck.&nbsp; Such incidents
are significant: trifles light as air, no doubt, but at least they showed
which way the wind blew.&nbsp; And did it not blow? <!-- page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>for
three days the sou&rsquo;-wester had been heaping up the sea-water against
the shores of Cardigan Bay.&nbsp; People remembered with misgivings
that an expected high tide coincided in time with the gale, and shook
their heads significantly as they went to bed on the eve of January
30th.</p>
<p>In the half light before sunrise, the classes, emerging from the
school-room after morning prayers, found the street between them and
the Terrace threaded by a stream of salt water, which was pouring over
the sea-wall in momently increasing volume.&nbsp; Skirting or jumping
the obstruction they reached the class-rooms, and work began.&nbsp;
But before morning school was over the stream had become a river, and
thrifty housewives were keeping out the flood from their ground-floors
by impromptu dams.&nbsp; Those who were well placed saw a memorable
sight that morn, as the terrible white rollers came remorselessly in,
sheeting the black cliff sides in the distance with columns of spouted
foam, then thundering on the low sea-wall, licking up or battening down
the stakes of its palisades, and scattering apart and volleying before
it the pebbles built in between them, till the village <!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>street
was heaped with the ruins of the barrier over which the waters swept
victoriously into the level plain beyond:</p>
<blockquote><p>The feet had hardly time to flee<br />
Before it brake against the knee,<br />
And all the world was in the sea.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those who were looking inland saw how</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the river&rsquo;s
bed<br />
A mighty eygre reared its head<br />
And up the Lery raging sped.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And though they could not see how the tenants of the low-lying hamlet
of Ynislas fled to their upper storey as the tide plunged them into
twelve feet of water; how it breached the railway beyond, sapping four
miles of embankment, and sweeping the bodies of a drowned flock of sheep
far inland to the very foot of the hills; yet they saw enough to make
them recall the grim memories of the historic shore, and doubt if our
fortunes were not about to add a chapter to the legend of the Lost Lowland
Hundred.</p>
<p>For an hour the narrow ridge on which the village stands was swept
by a storm of foam, while, from moment to moment, a wave exploding against
the crest of the ridge, would leap in through the <!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>intervals
between the houses, and carrying along a drift of sea-weed and shingle,
splintered timber, and wrecked peat-stacks, go eddying down into the
drowned pastures beyond.&nbsp; Yet when the ebb came, and men began
to count their losses, there were but few to record.&nbsp; The embankment
at the south end of the village had been beaten flat, and the road behind
it buried under a silt of shingle; the nearest houses to it had been
flooded and threatened with collapse, so that the owners were offering
them next day on easy terms; from our hospital, which stood in this
quarter, the one patient and his nurse were rescued on the backs of
waders; the foundations of a chapel, which was building on lower ground,
were reported sapped, and a staunch Churchman of our Welsh acquaintance
stood rapturously contrasting the fate of the conventicle with the security
of his own place of worship on the neighbouring knoll.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
Borth goes, the church won&rsquo;t, anyhow!&rdquo; he cried, in self-forgetting
fervour.&nbsp; No lives were lost, though several were barely saved.&nbsp;
One of our party rescued his dog, already straining at his chain to
escape a watery grave; another saved (dearer than life itself) his favourite
violin.&nbsp; A fisherman, surprised in his kitchen, was flung down
and nearly <!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>strangled
between door and doorpost by the rush of a wave through the window.&nbsp;
A neighbour was drifted out of his house on the top of one wave, and
scrambled back to find the door slammed and held against him by another.&nbsp;
Rueful groups of women stood in the street, sobbing over armfuls of
what one feared might be drowned infants, but were, in fact, the little
pigs which they had plucked alive and remonstrant from the flooded styes.&nbsp;
In short, if many were frightened, few could plead to being hurt.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the boys had found their way from the class-rooms upon
bridges of railway-sleepers requisitioned from the station-yard.&nbsp;
We could not but enjoy that &ldquo;something not altogether unpleasing
to us in the calamities of our neighbours,&rdquo; but the &ldquo;humorous
ruth,&rdquo; with which we contemplated the comical incidents of the
disaster was exchanged in good time for practical pity.&nbsp; There
was to be another high tide that evening, and how would the village
stand this second storm of its broken defences?&nbsp; So the order was
given to assemble in the street after dinner, and work at the repair
of the breaches.&nbsp; The street looked like an ant-hill, as the workers,
divided into gangs by houses, with the housemaster at the head of his
gang, swarmed <!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>on
the roadway, clearing it from the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> with pickaxe,
spade, and a multitude of hands; re-stacking the cottagers&rsquo; store
of peat-sods, which the waves had sown broadcast; forming chains across
the beach to pass up from hand to hand the large pebbles at low-water
mark, to build in between the palisades; or cutting down the old stakes
and driving in new ones.&nbsp; This last was the most attractive branch
of the service.&nbsp; How enviable was he whom a reputation as a woodman
secured the enjoyment of an axe, and the genial employ of hewing and
hammering!&nbsp; This was much to be preferred to cutting your hands
in moving rubbish or standing still to hand wet stones in a freezing
wind.&nbsp; However, the pleasure of helping other people was common
to all; and many of the young hearts, which tasted that pleasure in
this rough day&rsquo;s labour, will have gained an impulse of prompt
helpfulness that may serve them in other and ruder storms than that
which shook the frail homes of these friendly villagers.</p>
<p>We do not know how our defences would have stood the test of battle.&nbsp;
They were not put to the proof, for the wind, veering to the north that
morning, and blowing strongly all day, reduced again the volume of the
water in the bay, and the following <!-- page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>tides
came and went harmlessly.&nbsp; But had the morrow repeated the terrors
of this day, we should hardly have been up to witness them, for (<i>proh
pudor</i>!) we rewarded ourselves for our exertions by a lie-a-bed next
morning in place of early school.</p>
<p>Elsewhere the storm-wave had worked more havoc.&nbsp; At Ynyslas,
a flock of one hundred and fifteen sheep were caught in their pastures,
and drowned, the farmer rescuing only eleven.&nbsp; The cottagers were
driven to their lofts, while the tide snatched away their furniture,
doors, window-frames, and tables, and strewed them along the railway
banks.&nbsp; There was flotsam and jetsam on what was now once more
the coast-line at the village of Taliesin, where in old days the bard&rsquo;s
cradle had been washed ashore; here one poor woman recovered her parlour-table
of heavy oak; her chairs had travelled farther yet to the door of a
farmhouse in the extreme corner of the marsh.&nbsp; These people were
greater sufferers than our villagers, but we could only help them by
a subscription to replace their losses.</p>
<p>For ourselves, we suffered nothing except a temporary scarcity of
coals and oil from the interruption of the railway traffic.&nbsp; It
was a <!-- page 101--><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>fortnight
before the next train ran on the stretch between us and Machynlleth,
and in the meanwhile the gap was bridged by a coach service.&nbsp; From
four miles of embankment the ballast had been sapped away, and the sleepers
and rails collapsing into the void presented a dismal picture of wreck.</p>
<p>Yes, we suffered one other privation.&nbsp; It was long before our
football-field rose again from the deeps, and was dry enough for play.&nbsp;
Its goalposts pricking up mournfully through the floods were a landmark
which the boys recognised with rueful eyes in the midst of the drowned
and deformed landscape.</p>
<p>More substantial measures than the patching up of the barricades
in which we assisted must be taken if Borth is to remain permanently
in the roll of Welsh villages.&nbsp; Our storm-wave was but part of
a system of aggression which the sea is carrying out upon these coasts.&nbsp;
Older residents remember a coach-road under the promontory, where now
there is nothing but rock and seaweed, and look forward gloomily to
a day when Borth will be &ldquo;disturbed;&rdquo; for so they euphemistically
describe the catastrophe which is finally to wash it away.&nbsp; But
an acquaintance of ours, who claims one of the longest memories in the
place, is more <!-- page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>confident.&nbsp;
He has known Borth seventy years and as he has never seen it destroyed
during all that time, does not think it will be now.&nbsp; His own house
is safe on the hill of Old Borth, so he judges with all the calm of
conscious security.&nbsp; His conviction, however, is not shared by
his townsfolk, who were soon busy holding meetings, and considering
schemes for the provision of something better than these moral guarantees.&nbsp;
Heartily do we hope that funds and measures will be found to save our
friends from another and more calamitous &ldquo;disturbance.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But a letter from Borth, a year later, speaks of the sea as again threatening
their security.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are not afraid of him, though,&rdquo;
the correspondent, one of our landladies, devoutly adds, &ldquo;for
he is under a Master.&rdquo;&nbsp; All the same, we should like to hear
of a stout sea-wall as well.</p>
<p>Once again the elements caused us alarm.&nbsp; A heavy gale got up
in the evening of February 19th, and roared all night upon the roof
of the hotel, tearing up the fluttering tiles in patches, and sending
them adrift through the air, till the master who slept under the leads,
in charge of the top storey, began to doubt whether the straining roof
would last overhead till morning.&nbsp; It was small <!-- page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>consolation
that this time he and his neighbours should at least &ldquo;die a dry
death,&rdquo; so the inmates of the floor were summoned from their beds
in the small hours to spend the rest of the night in a bivouack on the
ground-floor.&nbsp; One or another of those luckless youngsters will,
in after days, remember, as a cheerful incident, the arrival on the
scene of the Headmaster, with a store of biscuits and such supplies
as could be requisitioned at the moment, to provision the watch.&nbsp;
Your schoolboy, he reflected, is hungry at all times; what must he be
at night when dragged from bed to save his life, and forced to sit up,
rather cold and very empty, for several hours before daybreak.&nbsp;
Solaced, however, by these beguilements, the hours passed cheerfully
away.</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The primal sympathy</i>,<br />
<i>Which</i>, <i>having been</i>, <i>must ever be</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Wordsworth</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thenceforward the weeks rolled smoothly on, unmarked by moving incident,
till they gladdened us with the growing light of spring, and brought
us within near sight of our home.&nbsp; Must the truth be told?&nbsp;
We are all of us loyal sons of Uppingham, but not all of us were glad
to find our return to the mother-country was at last arriving.&nbsp;
So far away from the offence, we need not fear attainder if we confess,
some few of us, that our hearts were not whole in their welcome of the
long-deferred event.&nbsp; It belonged to the irony that waits on all
lives which are not too dull a material for fortune&rsquo;s jests, that
<!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>we
should cease to desire our home just when long patience and often-thwarted
efforts, and</p>
<blockquote><p>The slow, sad hours which bring us all things ill,<br />
And all good things from evil,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>had brought its coveted security at last within our reach.&nbsp;
For so it was with some of us.&nbsp; Perhaps the air of sea and mountain
had got into the blood, and infected it with a certain disrelish for
the restraints, the even decorum, and the tamer surroundings of our
life in the Midlands.&nbsp; Well, we are not the only emigrants who
have preferred their backwoods to the streets of the mother city, nor
the first campaigners who have come back to home-quarters a trifle spoiled
by adventure.&nbsp; And, moreover, while everything about us was a reminder
of what we must forego, there was nothing to tell us of what a greeting
our townsmen were preparing for us, or of the solid mutual good which
filled the vista beyond that auspicious welcome.</p>
<p>However, alike for those who were impatient and those who were half
reluctant to attain it, the equal-handed hours brought the end of our
exile.&nbsp; On one of our last evenings, April 6th, <!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>a
reading was given in the school-room, &ldquo;A Midsummer Night&rsquo;s
Dream&rdquo; with Mendelssohn&rsquo;s music; no unfit close, we said,
to our <i>annns mirabilis</i>.&nbsp; For, indeed, its incidents had
been &ldquo;such stuff as dreams are made of,&rdquo; as whimsical if
not quite as harmless, as if their plot had been directed by the blithe
goblin of Shakespeare&rsquo;s fantasy.&nbsp; The chorus of readers and
of singers were so far encouraged by their success, as to offer a second
recital as a farewell entertainment to the good people of Borth.&nbsp;
They enjoyed it hugely.&nbsp; Doubtless some of the simpler members
of that audience would follow the drift of the Sassenach poet only at
a certain distance; but Bottom&rsquo;s &ldquo;transformed scalp,&rdquo;
a pasteboard ass&rsquo;s-head, come all the way from Nathan&rsquo;s,
was eloquent without help of an interpreter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh! that donkey,
he was beautiful,&rdquo; was the dramatic criticism of an esteemed friend,
a fisher&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; The criticism was at least sincere; from
the moment of the monster&rsquo;s entry she had been in one rapture
of laughter, till her &ldquo;face was like a wet cloak ill laid up.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Well, the kind soul had reason good enough for her merriment.&nbsp;
But had the reason been less, our neighbours would not have lost the
occasion of dropping the <!-- page 107--><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>shyness
of intercourse in a frank outburst of good fellowship.</p>
<p>But we took a more solemn farewell on the morrow, the 10th of April.&nbsp;
The parts were reversed now, and we were the spectators.&nbsp; Just
at sundown of a day of clear spring weather, the school was gathered
at their doors watching a long procession of villagers advancing up
the street towards them.&nbsp; We had heard whispers in the morning
of a &ldquo;demonstration,&rdquo; and now it was come.&nbsp; Through
the dust we caught sight of banners flying at the head of the column;
under them marched the choir of children singing, and behind them the
whole village was a-foot.&nbsp; The people of Borth, of every age and
degree, from the first householders and yeomen of the place to the fishermen&rsquo;s
boys and girls, had come to wish us God speed.&nbsp; Reaching the school
quarters they halted, the boys lining the roadway on each side of them,
and filling the broad flight of steps before the hotel doors.&nbsp;
When the cheers for &ldquo;Uppingham&rdquo; and our answering cheers
for &ldquo;Borth&rdquo; had rung out across the sands to seaward, there
was an interval, filled up with songs by the children, while they waited
the arrival of the spokesmen, whom <!-- page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>they
had charged with their valediction.&nbsp; When these arrived, a deputation
of the villagers moved into the school-room shed, and there presented
a brief address, which ran thus: &ldquo;We, the inhabitants of Borth,
beg to tender our most sincere thanks to Dr. Thring, and all the masters
and scholars of the celebrated Uppingham School, for the very many generous
acts and kindly feelings exhibited to us during their sojourn here.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The address was introduced and explained by speeches marked by refined
feeling, and delivered with a noticeable grace of manner.&nbsp; We will
here cite, though for another reason, a few words of the speaker who
moved the address; he commented on the discipline which (from the evidence
of their conduct when at large) seemed to rule the school; na&iuml;vely
but pointedly he noted that no offence had ever been given; &ldquo;No
boy had laughed at the villagers, if they were old and queer-looking
or queerly dressed; there had been no disorder, no shabby act, nothing
<i>un</i>decent&rdquo; (so he put it in his unpractised English) &ldquo;during
the whole twelve months we had spent among them.&rdquo;&nbsp; We give
his testimony without note or comment, sure that the facts would not
be better told in words less simple.&nbsp; They were little things he
witnessed to; <!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>was
it a little thing that the witness could be truly borne?</p>
<p>The boys were not present to hear the speeches, but they will like
well to remember the scene without doors at that unlooked-for reunion
of school and village.&nbsp; It was a scene made up of homely elements
enough, but somehow, in our own memory at least, few pictures will remain
printed in such fast colours.&nbsp; Clearly, as on that evening, we
shall always see, distinct in the quiet light of the afterglow, the
ranks of serious faces, touched and stilled by the surprise of a contagious
sympathy, as English boys and Welsh cottagers looked each other in the
face, and felt, if for the space of a few heartbeats only, an outflash
of that ancient kinship which binds man and man together more than race
and circumstance divide.</p>
<p>It pleases the smaller kind of criticism to cheapen the meaning of
such incidents as this, and explain them by the easy reference to interested
and conventional motives.&nbsp; Wiser men will take occasion to rejoice
that human nature is after all so kind; and if this be error, we would
rather err with the wise.&nbsp; Take once again our thanks, kind people
of Borth, if our thanks are worth your taking.&nbsp; You showed us no
little kindness in a <!-- page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>strange
land, and the day is far off when we shall forget the friendly, gentle
people whose name is the memorial of a great ill escaped, of much good
enjoyed, in the days that are over, and the landmark of who knows what
greater good in the days that are to be.</p>

<p>All is over now; April was just a twelfth-night old when the school
departed.&nbsp; Some of our company have lingered on for business, a
few from reluctance to have done with it.&nbsp; But to-day <!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>the
last group has taken wing for the Midlands.&nbsp; Old &ldquo;Borth,&rdquo;
the colley dog, followed them to the station, and poked his nose into
the carriage to take his leave.&nbsp; Old Borth&mdash;we had almost
forgotten him, and that had been deep ingratitude for he was not the
least warm-hearted of our friends in Wales.&nbsp; His master lived two
miles away; but soon after our arrival, Borth had come down from the
hills to attach himself to our fortunes, and henceforth became, as it
were, our familiar, the pet of the regiment, like the goat of the &ldquo;23rd.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He knew his position, and was a stickler for formalities; he had a wag
of the tail for every boy who wore the image of the venerable schoolmaster
upon his cap; but if he met him bare-headed, or, by any chance, in an
indistinctive head-gear, he would cut that boy dead, were he never so
much the same urchin from whose hand he had yesterday eaten a cheese-cake.&nbsp;
That was his official rebuke for the irregularity.&nbsp; By day, Borth
would bask in some sunny corner of our quarters; at night, he has been
known to venture on a nearer intimacy where doors were left open.&nbsp;
We found you once ourselves, Borth, curled up and asleep upon our own
bed.&nbsp; You woke up, shook yourself with a modest, but not startled
<!-- page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>manner,
and walked quietly away, like a gentleman.</p>
<p>Ah! kind friend, you showed us the sincerest of flatteries, that
of imitation.&nbsp; You left a comfortable home for chance quarters
and uncertain fare, that you might be one of us, an outcast among outcasts.&nbsp;
Now we must part, for our home will spare us no longer, as neither will
yours spare you.&nbsp; And so the last good-bye is said, and you are
limping away to your hills again, with dejection expressed in every
fibre of your frame, from the drooping ears to the last hair on your
tail.</p>
<p>All is over, and the place is very silent, except for the clink of
hammers where they are breaking down our wooden walls, and, seaward,
the cry and splash of gull and tern dipping for their prey in the shoal
of herring-fry which is wandering about the bay.&nbsp; Close inshore
a porpoise is wallowing, like the jolly sea-pig that he is, in his berth
of glistening water.&nbsp; The wild creatures seem to have grown tamer
since there are no strollers to keep them aloof.&nbsp; This morning,
as we passed his pool, the stately heron let us come within twenty yards
of him before he got leisurely upon the wing.&nbsp; The village seems
even quieter; the people at their doors betray, to our fancy, a certain
lassitude <!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>as
if, like merrymakers on the morrow of a revel, they felt somewhat sleepy
and sorry, now that the stirring social year is over, and the little
fishing town has returned to its &ldquo;old solitary nothingness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, the silence has come down again; but it is a silence full of
voices.&nbsp; For, as it often happens that, when things without are
stillest, men hear most audibly the tumult of their own brains, so is
it now with us.&nbsp; Action is ended, and memory begins to work.&nbsp;
Into the vacuum which the silence makes, the stream of our little history
pours in a long backwater.&nbsp; Our thoughts go back to the beginning
of it, the hour when, as we were sailing prosperously under press of
canvas, the blast struck us suddenly out of a sunny sky.&nbsp; We live
again the slow months of enforced vacation, and the brief spell of apparent
security, broken by the second stroke.&nbsp; We recall the slow and
painful sickening of hope, amid the frustration of attempted remedies;
the watchings and communings by late firesides; the morning questionings
and bulletins; the deepening of fears, until the moment when the sharp
pressure of calamity became the liberating touch, and made a hazardous
adventure seem a welcome alternative.&nbsp; Not less <!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>distinctly
we remember the zest with which the wretched waiting for evil tidings
was exchanged for hopeful activity; the rush of preparations; the anxiety
which watched their passage through the ordeal of practice; the growing
sense of security; the mellowing down of novelty and privation into
routine and ease; the contrast, all the while, between the outward peace
of the colony, and the secret difficulties of finance and commissariat;
the long intermittent crisis which gave the administrative no rest;
the hopes and efforts for our return home, and the reversal of them;
all this, and&mdash;and&mdash;very much else as well, which was of acutest
interest at the time, and which it will become convenient to describe
only when it will be of interest to no one.&nbsp; All this passes before
us in the series of a long dissolving view, full of bright lights, and
only less full of unlovely shadows.</p>
<p>And, somehow, as we review the past this evening, pacing the beach
in the twilight, the fact accomplished seems to us not smaller, but
greater than when we lived in it.&nbsp; There are moments some would
say of illusion, some of vision&mdash;when the things most familiar
to our eyes and thoughts, whether in nature or human society, surprise
us <!-- page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>with
a dignity and beauty not discovered in them before.&nbsp; That glamour
is in the air this evening.&nbsp; Perhaps the night-wind, which creeps
to us from over the grassy tomb of Taliesin, warrior and bard has touched
the fancy with a breath out of his heroic days.&nbsp; What wonder if
it were so?&nbsp; Thirteen centuries ago the hero became the guardian
of the shore; but the story which ends to-day is, perhaps, as worthy
note as any he has watched from his hill-side.&nbsp; Those who rate
the dignity of human action by other standards than the breadth and
conspicuousness of its stage, will not mock us because we find some
stuff of romance in the homely circumstance and not always epic passages
of this modern episode of school.</p>
<p>But if the stranger who may read the tale will spare his scorn&mdash;those
for whom we shall tell it would forgive even a bolder word; for some
of them were themselves a part of it, and others will make it a part
of their heritage in the past.&nbsp; English schools have always honoured
their traditions, counting them the better part of their wealth.&nbsp;
Some have majestic memories of royal benefactors, or can point to a
muster-roll of splendid names, whose greatness was cradled in their
walls.&nbsp; Such traditions <!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>are
not ours.&nbsp; A past, not brief, but not memorable, has denied us
these.&nbsp; But a tradition we have henceforward which is all our own
and wholly single in its kind.&nbsp; We persuade ourselves that in far-off
years those who bear our name will say that, in the memory of a great
disaster overcome, no mean heirloom has been left them.&nbsp; They will
not be ashamed of a generation which, in an hour of extreme peril, did
not despair of the commonwealth, but dared to trust their faith in a
further destiny, and saved for those who should come after them a cause
which must else have perished in the dark.&nbsp; <i>Stet fortuna domus</i>.&nbsp;
And stand it will if there is assurance in augury.&nbsp; For the fairy
legend has a truth in fact, and the luck of a house, grasped daringly
and held fast in an act of venturous hardihood, will not break or be
lost again until the sons forget to guard it.</p>
<p>Here and there, at any rate, among the posterity which will sometime
fill our ranks, there will not be wanting generous and gifted spirits,
<i>illustres anim&aelig; nostrumque in nomen iturae</i>, who will rejoice
in making good the forecast that the venture was not made in vain.&nbsp;
They will possess more worthily the good which an elder <!-- page 118--><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>race
foresaw and laboured not all unworthily to preserve.&nbsp; To their
safe keeping we commend as under a seal, the legacy of hopes which are
better left unspoken now.</p>

<h3>HOW WE LEFT BORTH.</h3>
<p>(<i>From</i> &ldquo;<i>The Cambrian News</i>.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>On Tuesday evening, April 10, the inhabitants of Borth, almost to
a man, turned out to take part in a farewell demonstration to the masters
and scholars of Uppingham School, after their twelve months&rsquo; residence
in Wales.&nbsp; Shortly after seven o&rsquo;clock a procession of the
inhabitants was formed, and, headed by a flag-bearer, made its way to
the square in front of the Cambrian Hotel, where several songs were
sung by the assembly under the schoolmaster&rsquo;s (Mr. Jones&rsquo;s)
direction; and at the conclusion a hearty round of cheers was given
for the Uppingham School, who immediately responded by making the place
ring again with three enthusiastic cheers for Borth.&nbsp; The assembly
then adjourned to the wooden building in the hotel-yard, when Mr. Jones,
Brynowen, was voted to the chair on the proposition of Mr. Lewis, Post
Office, seconded by Mr. Jones, Neptune Baths.</p>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span> said, as the meeting was
aware, the object of the demonstration&mdash;and he was exceedingly
glad to see such a popular demonstration&mdash;was, that the Borth people
might have a chance of giving public expression to the kind feeling
of respect they entertained for Mr. Thring, the masters, and scholars
of Uppingham <!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>School
before they left Borth, after a twelve months&rsquo; sojourn there.&nbsp;
(Cheers.)&nbsp; When some twelve months ago a rumour came to Borth respecting
the advent of Uppingham School, a few old women and nervous people,
in the innocence of their hearts, were afraid they would be swamped
by an inundation of Goths and Vandals.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; The meeting
would, however, agree with him that kinder-hearted gentlemen than the
masters, and better-behaved boys than the scholars, could not be found.&nbsp;
(Hear, hear.)&nbsp; There had been no town-and-gown feeling existing
similar to what prevailed in places of greater pretensions.&nbsp; The
people of the village and the School had pulled together in a friendly
manner, and everything had gone on quite smoothly.&nbsp; (Hear.)&nbsp;
After referring to the progress of the School under the headmastership
of Mr. Thring, and remarking that the older schools would have to look
to their laurels, as Uppingham was treading close upon their heels,
the Chairman said that in some fifteen or twenty years to come many
of the boys would be in Parliament, some of them officers in the army
or navy, fighting the battles of the nation, some of them would be barristers,
seeing that the people got fair play in the courts of law, others would
no doubt be eminent merchants, importing the produce of foreign countries,
whilst others would be surgeons, like Dr. Childs&mdash;(loud cheering)&mdash;and
physicians.&nbsp; They would therefore exercise an influence over the
destinies of the nation.&nbsp; (Cheers.)&nbsp; The people of Borth were
exceedingly sorry that the school was going away.&nbsp; Its members
would be missed very much indeed.&nbsp; He owed the Uppingham people
no ill-feeling, but if a case of smallpox, the cholera, or some other
virulent disease broke out in that place and prevented the return of
the school, he was sure that <!-- page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>Borth
people would not feel at all sorry.&nbsp; (Laughter and cheers.)&nbsp;
There was the name of a gentleman whom he might mention.&nbsp; That
gentleman had earned the gratitude of the Borth people perhaps more
than anyone else.&nbsp; He referred to Dr. Childs.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;
He had acted the part of the Good Samaritan thoroughly, responding as
readily to the call of the sick and suffering at midnight as at noon.&nbsp;
(Cheers.)&nbsp; He would detain them no longer, but ask Mr. Lewis to
submit a proposition to the meeting.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lewis</span>, Post Office, said he had very
great pleasure in reading the resolution, because he knew it would be
heartily responded to by everyone present.&nbsp; It was as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;We,
the inhabitants of Borth, beg to tender our most sincere thanks to Dr.
Thring, and all the masters and scholars of the celebrated Uppingham
School, for the very many generous acts and kindly feelings exhibited
towards us during their sojourn here.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Lewis followed
by commenting upon the excellent discipline which evidently ruled the
school, judging from their exemplary conduct out of school.&nbsp; He
was not aware of any shabby, mean, or ungenerous act committed by the
young gentlemen during the whole twelve months they had been at Borth.&nbsp;
(Applause.)&nbsp; The meeting would remember the assistance rendered
in the terrific storm in February.&nbsp; Even the ladies came out and
helped the people in their distress&mdash;(loud applause)&mdash;thereby
setting an excellent example to the women of Borth.&nbsp; (Cheers.)&nbsp;
They had not only worked as hard as they could, but subscribed money
among themselves which they distributed to the most needy of those who
had sustained loss by the storm.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; The money then
distributed would pass into other hands in a short time, but the kind
feelings the act engendered would last <!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>for
ever.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; He only hoped that each and all connected
with Uppingham School would enjoy long, prosperous, and useful lives.&nbsp;
(Loud applause.)</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>, The Baths, expressed the fears
he once entertained, in common with others, that the Uppingham School
would take Borth by storm, an opinion he had to change entirely after
the boys had been there a week, for instead of laughing at the quaintness
of some of the Welsh costumes or the peculiarities of the nation, they
had obtained the goodwill of the inhabitants by their gentleness of
demeanour, and completely won their hearts on that memorable day when
masters and scholars, young and old, turned out to assist in reducing,
as much as possible, the ill-effects of the storm.&nbsp; (Cheers.)&nbsp;
He did not exactly wish that some contagious disease would break out
at Uppingham, but he hoped that when the School got back it would repent,
and so return to Borth.&nbsp; (Laughter and cheers.)</p>
<p>Speeches were also made by Mr. Thomas G. Thomas and Mr. R. Pritchard
Roberts, Garibaldi House.</p>
<p>The Rev. E. <span class="smcap">Thring</span>, M.A., then rose amid
cheers and said: Mr. Chairman and our friends at Borth, I have made
many speeches in my life since I have been master of this school.&nbsp;
Two-and-twenty years of school-mastering gives a good deal of exercise
for the tongue from time to time; but never in my life have I stood
up to make any speech which I feel so little capable of making as I
do to-night; not from want of practice, but because the feelings you
have aroused in us are such&mdash;and our sojourn here has been such
a boon to us (cheers)&mdash;that it is impossible for me to tell you
the value we set on living here, and the welcome we have received.&nbsp;
(Applause.)&nbsp; I never heard anything sweeter to my ear <!-- page 123--><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>than
your singing to-night.&nbsp; The time it must have taken, the goodwill
manifested in the songs, and altogether the circumstances under which
they were delivered, and we on our last day here, made them go down
into my heart, and into all our hearts with peculiar power.&nbsp; (Cheers.)&nbsp;
Never in my life have I had such testimony to the school which I cared
so much for, as the testimony you have given to-night.&nbsp; We get
our reputation in the English world, but what is that compared to the
inner life to which you have borne witness.&nbsp; What signifies it
whether we know much or little in comparison with the fact that we have
a character of life which you like.&nbsp; It is life answering unto
life across all those ties, both of nationality&mdash;for I grieve I
cannot speak in your native tongue&mdash;and also of distance which
set gulfs between man and man, but cannot separate life when it is true.&nbsp;
(Hear, hear.)&nbsp; If your life is true, and our lives are true, then
it flows across and we meet as to-night one united body of living men.&nbsp;
(Cheers.)&nbsp; And this is what gives a peculiar value to our being
here.&nbsp; You know as none can know what this school is.&nbsp; We
came among you as strangers, and you looked upon us with the eyes of
strangers; we stayed among you as friends, and we part from you as friends.&nbsp;
(Cheers.)&nbsp; Everybody knows that the one thing on earth which makes
life pleasant is the friendly atmosphere in which men live&mdash;the
one thing that makes it hateful is to be surrounded by thoroughly bitter
hearts.&nbsp; There is an old saying that &ldquo;stone walls do not
a prison make, nor iron bars a cage.&rdquo;&nbsp; No, the life within
can make any place enjoyable&mdash;nay, happy.&nbsp; Yet, I think it
is better to be in happy surroundings too.&nbsp; Of this, however, you
may be sure: those glorious hills of yours, this sea, and <!-- page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>all
the happy hours we have spent wandering about, will not easily pass
out of our minds.&nbsp; The jewel of a friendly spirit has also been
set in very bright surroundings.&nbsp; We do rejoice in the life we
have had here, and all that we have found.&nbsp; (Cheers.)&nbsp; You
have spoken to-night of the good conduct of the school, and have said
that we have caused no trouble since our stay here.&nbsp; That like
many other questions, has two sides.&nbsp; Is it not a great credit
to this place that when between a hundred and seventy and a hundred
and eighty strange boys have been put into your cottages and homes,
there has not arisen a single difficulty for the whole year?&nbsp; I
say it is quite as much a feather in your caps as in ours.&nbsp; I am
proud of it&mdash;very proud of it.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; I would
also refer to the extensive power which lies in a great school.&nbsp;
It is quite true that some few years hence, these boys whom you have
looked on with interest will be schoolmasters, barristers, and leaders
in every part of the world.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; There is not a quarter
of the globe where we have not our representative.&nbsp; It is now,
and not in the future only, that I may venture to say that there is
no part of this globe where men are to be found, where, here and there,
Borth has not been heard of this year.&nbsp; (Cheers.)&nbsp; I will
mention two facts only which may interest you.&nbsp; This very week,
quite unconscious of this meeting to-night, I sent a letter to North
Canada, with, I may say, a very glowing account of Borth in it&mdash;(cheers)&mdash;and
the day before yesterday, having a little leisure, I wrote to the Lieutenant-Governor
of the North-West Provinces of India, when I mentioned Borth in equally
warm terms.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; That, I need not say, is going on
all around us.&nbsp; These three hundred pens of our school are busy
day <!-- page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>by
day giving to their friends their own views of our life here, and I
may no doubt say that on the whole they are pleasant views.&nbsp; (Cheers.)&nbsp;
It is not only a pleasant fact to mention, but I hold that where life
is working well with life it is a real power for good that goes out
into all lands, a sort of missionary force traversing this earth, speaking
of us as capable of coming here, and of the welcome you have given us.&nbsp;
(Hear, hear.)&nbsp; That, however, would be a slight thing if we did
not leave behind us, as I am sure we do, that feeling of happy life
which we take away with us.&nbsp; (Cheers.)&nbsp; For my own part, at
all events, if I leave, it is not the last time I hope to spend in Borth.&nbsp;
(Applause.)&nbsp; I know no place that has been more attractive to me,
no place where, if I can, I shall more readily come back to&mdash;not,
I hope, next time as an exile, but coming from home to happy holiday
to spend it pleasantly among my friends here.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Lewis</span> proposed a hearty vote of thanks
to Dr. Childs for his gratuitous attendance on the sick in his professional
capacity.&nbsp; (Loud cheers.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Childs</span> referred to the pleasure experienced
in doing a kindly action, and afterwards humorously added that at one
time he thought of setting up in practice at Borth, but finding the
place so healthy he had given up the idea.&nbsp; (Laughter and cheers.)&nbsp;
He should, however, know where to send his convalescent patients in
future.&nbsp; He should recommend them to take the first train, and
spend a week on the sands at Borth, with an occasional dip in the Neptune
Baths.&nbsp; (Loud laughter and cheers.)&nbsp; Three cheers were given
for the ladies of Uppingham School, and the assembly separated after
singing the National Anthem.</p>
<h3><!-- page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>HOW
WE CAME BACK TO UPPINGHAM.</h3>
<p>(<i>From the</i> <span class="smcap">School Magazine</span>.)</p>
<p>(<i>Signifer, statue signum, hic manebimus optime</i>.)</p>
<p>Who has not known the moment when, as he looked on some familiar
landscape, its homely features and sober colouring have suddenly, under
some chance inspiration of the changing sky, become alive with an unexpected
beauty: its unambitious hills take on them the dignity of mountains,
its woods and streams swell and broaden with a majesty not their own.&nbsp;
Though, perhaps, it is their own, if Nature, like Man, is most herself
when seen in her best self; if her brightest moments are her truest.</p>
<p>Shall we be thought fanciful if we confess that we felt something
of this same kind when, returning from a year-long exile, in the last
gleams of a bright May evening we turned the corner of the High Street
of Uppingham, and came face to face with our welcome.&nbsp; The old
street, seen again at last after so many months of banishment, the same
and not the same; the old, homely street&mdash;forgive us, walls and
roofs of Uppingham, and forgive us, you who tenant them, if sometimes
perhaps to some of us, as our eyes swept the grand range of Welsh mountain-tops,
or travelled out over limitless sea distances, there would rise forbidden
feelings of reluctance to exchange these fair things for the bounded
views and less unstinted beauties of our midland home: forgive us, as
you may the more readily because these thoughts, if any such lingered,
were charmed away on the instant by the sight of the real Uppingham.&nbsp;
There lay the path to our home, an avenue of triumphal arches soaring
on pillars of greenery, plumed with sheaves of banners, and enscrolled
with such words as those to whom they spoke <!-- page 127--><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>will
know how to read and remember.&nbsp; Our eyes could follow through arch
after arch the reaches of the gently-winding street, alive from end
to end with waving flags, green boughs, and fanciful devices, till the
quiet golden light in the western sky closed the vista, and glorified
with such a touch of its own mellow splendour the ranges of brown gables
and their floating banners, that for a moment we half dreamed ourselves
spectators of an historic pageant in some &ldquo;dim, rich city&rdquo;
of old-world renown.&nbsp; Only for a moment, though; for when we drop
our eyes to the street below us, those are our own townsfolk, well-remembered
faces, that throng every doorstep and fill the overflowing pavements
and swarming roadway.&nbsp; Yes, they are our own townsfolk, and they
are taking care to let us know it&mdash;such a welcome they have made
ready for us.</p>
<p>We hardly know how to describe with the epic dignity which it merits
the act by which they testified their joy at our return.&nbsp; We who
saw the sight were reminded of an incident in the &AElig;neid&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Instar montis equum divina Palladis arte<br />
Aedificant, sectaque intexunt abiete costas;<br />
Votum pro reditu simulant.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pueri circum innuptaeque puellae<br />
Sacra canuut, funemque manu contingere gaudent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the ill-starred folk of Troy could not have shown more enthusiasm
in haling within their walls the fatal wooden horse, than did the men
and boys of Uppingham, who harnessed themselves, some four-score of
them, to that guileless structure, which, though indeed it has some
other name, we will call at present our triumphal car.&nbsp; They harnessed
themselves to it at the <!-- page 128--><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>east-end
of the town, and drew it with the pomp of a swarming multitude all the
length of the long street to its western mouth and half the way back
again.&nbsp; On went that unwieldy car of triumph, bearing a freight
of eager faces behind its windows, and carrying a crowd of sitters,
precariously clustered wherever a perch could be found on its swaying
roof, under the verdant span of the arches and the flow of the streamers:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ilia subit medi&aelig;que minans inlabitur urbi.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On it went, with the hum of applauding voices increasing round it,
till the popular fervour found articulate utterance in a burst of jubilant
music.&nbsp; There swept past our ears, first, the moving strains of
&ldquo;Auld lang syne,&rdquo; and then, as if in answer to the appeal
to &ldquo;Auld acquaintance,&rdquo; came the jocund chorus &ldquo;There
is nae luck about the house&rdquo;&mdash;most eloquent assurance that
we were welcome home.&nbsp; And then in turn the music died down, and
the crowd round the now halted procession cheered with a will for &ldquo;the
school,&rdquo; &ldquo;the Headmaster and the masters,&rdquo; and the
school taking up with zest the genial challenge, returned the blessing
with such a shout as if they meant the echoes of that merry evening
to make amends in full to street and houses for their fourteen months
of silence.</p>
<p>It was &ldquo;all over but the shouting:&rdquo; but that was not
over till some hours of dusk had gathered over school and town.&nbsp;
For first the multitude besieged the well-known mighty gates, behind
which lies the studious quiet of the Schoolhouse Quad.&nbsp; When they
were admitted they came in like a flood, and filled the space within;
but for all they were so many, there was an orderliness and quietude
in the strange assemblage which made their <!-- page 129--><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>presence
there seem not strange at all, and they listened like one man to the
words in which the Headmaster, who came out to meet them, framed his
thanks for this unequivocal welcome.&nbsp; This done, they flowed out
again, and streamed across the valley and up the hill to carry the same
message of goodwill to the distant houses, and so with more cheering
and more speeches came to an end a day of happiest omen for the joint
fortunes of Uppingham School and Town.</p>
<p>A few additional details are needed to complete our account.&nbsp;
A friend, remarkable for his plain common-sense, reminds us that the
epic vehicle we so indistinctly describe, was the Seaton &rsquo;bus,
and that the music was due to &ldquo;the splendid band connected with
Mrs. Edmonds&rsquo; menagerie, which happened to be in the town.&rdquo;&nbsp;
We are not in a position to deny either statement, or another to the
effect that &ldquo;the conveyances which accompanied the &rsquo;bus
formed a procession of considerable length,&rdquo; having been halted
by arrangement outside the town, and formed into file for the entry.&nbsp;
When the same friend hazards some further criticism on a confusion of
dates and incidents in our narrative, in which he finds the events of
two days, a Friday and a Saturday, presented as in a single scene, we
feel it time to silence him by an appeal, which he does not follow,
to the &ldquo;truer historic sense&rdquo; and the &ldquo;massive grouping&rdquo;
of imaginative history.</p>
<h3>THE ADDRESS.</h3>
<p>On Tuesday of the next week, May 8, an address was presented by a
deputation of the townspeople to the Headmaster and assistant masters.&nbsp;
The ceremony took place in the school-room, the body of which was almost
<!-- page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>filled
by those who had assembled to support their deputation, while the masters,
their families, and the Sixth Form were seated on the tiers of the orchestra.&nbsp;
The deputation coming forward, Mr. Bell said that Mr. Hawthorn and himself
had been requested by their fellow townsmen to undertake the presentation
of an address, in explanation of which he would make a few remarks.&nbsp;
In an appreciative speech he reviewed the circumstances which had given
rise to the present occasion, gave some explanation of the form and
terms of the address, and took occasion to add that although the ladies
were not mentioned in the address, the townspeople were not unmindful
of the energetic way in which they had seconded the efforts of the masters.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Hawthorn</span> said he had been asked to
read the Address, but that he was unwilling to do so without some slight
expression of the feelings with which he and others took part in the
presentation of it.&nbsp; Though they were met to congratulate the school,
they felt, he said, that there were good grounds to congratulate themselves
as townsmen.&nbsp; The absence of the school had pressed with greater
or less severity on many tradesmen, being felt more especially by a
large number of the poorer inhabitants, and had made it evident to many
how poor a place Uppingham would be without a school upon its present
important scale.&nbsp; But they valued the School on other grounds too;
they recognize the advantage of the presence among them of so many representatives
of liberal education and its broader views on matters of public interest.&nbsp;
To the Headmaster it must be a cause for rejoicing and thankfulness
that the labour of his life had been saved from a sudden and unfortunate
conclusion.&nbsp; To him and his assistant masters, the parents, and
the <!-- page 131--><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>boys,
by whose loyal adherence the time of trial had been happily passed through,
their congratulations were offered.&nbsp; He proceeded to read the address,
which was received with much applause by the townspeople.&nbsp; It is
a handsomely illuminated document, to which between sixty and seventy
names are attached; the terms of it are as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>To the Rev. Edward Thring, M.A., Headmaster, and to the
Assistant Masters of Uppingham School</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&mdash;We, the undersigned residents in Uppingham,
have great pleasure in meeting you with a hearty welcome on the re-assembling
of the school in full numbers in its native home, and gladly avail ourselves
of this opportunity of conveying to you our congratulations that the
period of anxiety and trial through which you have so successfully passed
has clearly demonstrated the sound principles upon which the school
has been conducted, and which have raised it to its present eminence
as one of the great schools of the country, and have won for it the
confidence of parents in all parts of the kingdom, many of whom have
entrusted their sons to your care at Borth, and are continuing that
trust now that you are returning to your homes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We desire also to express our sense of the courage and enterprise
manifested in removing the school from Uppingham at the time of the
anxious crisis in February, 1876.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we pray Almighty God that it may please Him to bless the
school, and that under His guidance those who from time to time leave
the school may as scholars and Christian gentlemen uphold its fame in
whatever sphere they may be placed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Uppingham</i>, <i>May</i>, 1877.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 132--><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>The
<span class="smcap">Headmaster</span> then rose and said: &ldquo;Mr.
Bell, Mr. Hawthorn, and friends in Uppingham,&mdash;Home is home, and
you may be quite sure that we, at all events, who went through exile
felt it indeed to be home when we came back again.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;
It does not signify what the circumstances may be, but it is not possible
to live long in a place and to have your home there without taking root
in it, and having fibres sent deep which cannot be torn up without pain.&nbsp;
(Applause.)&nbsp; We are very grateful, therefore, for the hearty, the
enthusiastic welcome you gave us on our return.&nbsp; (Cheers.)&nbsp;
Assuredly as our eyes looked on this pleasant hill and the familiar
fields, we felt a deep thankfulness for the great peril passed, the
page of life turned, and a year such as never can come again closed
with success.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And it is a pleasant spot to look
on when you come down the dip of the valley before you near Uppingham,
and look up and see the ancient homes crowning the brow of the hill&mdash;it
is a fair sight to any eye, even to a stranger&rsquo;s eye, the pleasant
homes of Uppingham, with the church and its spire in the midst, the
spire of the school chapel beyond, each adding, methinks, to the beauty
of the other, and both alike in their upward spring and their holy worship.&nbsp;
It <i>is</i> a pleasant spot to look on, and you made your old picturesque
street very beautiful with your decorations and that bright outbreak
of welcome which greeted us as we came in.&nbsp; (Cheers.)&nbsp; The
school hardly knew what we meant&mdash;they did not know when we asked
them to cheer at the top of the hill; but as the stream of life wound
round and came in sight of that avenue of arches and flags, then they
understood what was meant, and they were ready enough to second it.&nbsp;
(Cheers.)&nbsp; We were very thankful, also, that you recognise in that
<!-- page 133--><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>address&mdash;that
able address and pleasing to receive&mdash;how hard it was to go, how
great a risk had to be faced to save the school; for that was what was
at stake.&nbsp; I do not say that in years to come there should not
again have been a school as great as this, or greater; but this I am
sure of, that we were in the very last week of the life of this present
school; that at the beginning of the week, when it was decided to go,
there was news from different quarters that made it absolutely certain
that another Monday would have seen no school here.&nbsp; For a school
is not a mere machine which can be set going to order, and which anybody
who happens at the time to have the mastery of can deal with like a
machine.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can call spirits from the vasty deep,&rdquo;
says Shakespeare in one of his plays; and the rejoinder comes, &ldquo;Why,
so can I, or so can any man; but will they come when you do call for
them?&rdquo;&nbsp; (Laughter and cheers.)&nbsp; Now that is just what
they won&rsquo;t do; and we simply had no choice; we lay absolutely
helpless before the fact that ruin stared us in the face, and we could
not stir hand or foot to stop it unless we had been able then to find
a door of escape.&nbsp; This present school was at an end, and neither
I nor some others amongst us could have set foot again in Uppingham
as our home.&nbsp; Now I do assure you ruin is a hard thing to look
on after a life-work of many years of labour&mdash;not a less hard thing
because the sun rose as usual, and it was all peace, and the buildings
looked as of old, and the fields were just as they had always been;
but an invisible barrier had risen up, and we had no place here any
more.&nbsp; To see the four-and-twenty years of life go at a touch&mdash;indeed
it was hard to think of.&nbsp; &ldquo;For my part, I have built my heart
in the courses of the wall&rdquo;&mdash;(cheers)&mdash;and nothing short
of this impelled us <!-- page 134--><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>to
that dire necessity of leaping in the dark, to go we did not know where,
and when we found the <i>where</i>, not knowing who would follow us.&nbsp;
But it was worth while to run any risk&mdash;to face any danger&mdash;to
keep together the life of this place, and that its name should not go
out in England.&nbsp; (Loud cheers.)&nbsp; We did not know who would
follow us, and it was a day to be remembered&mdash;a day of much cheer,
though full of labour and trial and fear also, when on that 4th of April
three hundred came in.&nbsp; (Loud applause.)&nbsp; Not above two or
three that night were wanting of those who were going to remain at the
school.&nbsp; (Cheers.)&nbsp; Well have you taken in your address that
staunch adherence of parent and boy as the proudest honour that a school
can boast of (cheers), and well have you noted that at Borth also the
entries kept level with the leavings, and that we have brought back
this year&mdash;this day&mdash;almost a hundred boys who had never seen
Uppingham.&nbsp; (Renewed cheering.)&nbsp; This was worth fighting for;
this is worth rejoicing.&nbsp; The school was saved, and we and you
to-night once more meet together as one body.&nbsp; (Loud applause.)&nbsp;
We are united now as we never have been before methinks (cheers); for
never before, to my knowledge, in England, have town and school been
so completely welded together as your welcome to us home and our presence
here together to-night shows us to be now.&nbsp; (Loud and long-continued
applause.)&nbsp; There have been many blessings in this great trial,
but certainly not least do I set that, that we and you are once more
met as one.&nbsp; Your work and ours is so mixed up&mdash;our work so
mixed with yours, and yours with ours&mdash;that it is not possible
that anything should go out of this place, any life come forth from
it, which does <!-- page 135--><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>not
to a great degree bring honour or discredit to both; and I do think
(what was said to-night) that we are here together to work in the highest
way, not as a matter of pecuniary advantage only in a place like this,
but simply that we, one with another, should push forward life and make
it crown that living edifice of truth, which, as it seems to me, is
town and school working together.&nbsp; And what a type that town is.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A city set upon a hill cannot be hid;&rdquo; and surely as a
school and a home, a home of learning and light, this place is both
actually and figuratively set upon its hill.&nbsp; Everything of the
past year has gone out into land after land, in letters and papers and
narratives on all sides: the busy-boy mind and the busy-boy pen photographs
most accurately all the minute incidents that interest their opening
life, and it passes out everywhere.&nbsp; I know that in India, and
China, and Australia, and Canada&mdash;and I might go on with half the
countries in the world&mdash;there has been talk in many a distant home
of what has happened here.&nbsp; It may very well be that at this moment
your names are on many lips as letters of English news have come in
lately from England, and your welcome of us will travel out to the ends
of the earth, so great is the power of &ldquo;a city set upon a hill.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And when you pray that we may be Christian gentlemen in the life that
is coming, I say it lies a great deal in your own hands.&nbsp; Help
us by so smoothing our path in all ways so that your honour may be our
honour and your work our work, and that as we are grateful to you to-night
so the world outside may be grateful to you also for work hereafter,
and that none shall go out of Uppingham School and shall not carry wherever
he goes a thankful memory of Uppingham town, and that whenever the name
of Uppingham is <!-- page 136--><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>heard
in any part of the world it shall be that of an honoured place, with
no divided interest, but one place working wisely, so that the world
may be grateful for good work done, as we to-night are grateful for
the welcome given, grateful for the lightening of our burdens, grateful
for the possibility of good work in the future, most grateful for the
happy homes you have given us in welcoming us home so fervently.&nbsp;
I thank you most heartily in the name of the school and the masters
and myself for this address, which I trust will for ever remain not
the least honoured relic of this school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Headmaster sat down again amid much cheering from the audience
of townspeople, to which the small party of boys present found voice
to make no ineffective answer in three salutes &lsquo;for Uppingham
town.&rsquo;</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
